 Unauthorised change 

On 26 January 2014 (i.e. just in the last few weeks), User:Mzilikazi1939 changed this article from the standard form of writing dates in the English language to CE/BCE. As he well knows, this violates WP:MOS, specifically WP:ERA, which requires that any change to an article's date style first be discussed on the talk page and justified with article-specific reasons before consensus is established and the article is then ready to be changed. As is clearly evident to everyone, none of these steps have taken place in this case.

Instead, in the two and fro of the last few weeks as Aesop has gone back and forth between the Queen's English and CE/BCE, Mzilikazi and his friends have claimed that the comments much further up this talk page and dated 20 months ago constitute the necessary discussion and consensus for the change of 26/01/14. Apart from the obvious fact that the article remained in the standard English state for 20 months continuously (May 2012 to January 2014), those comments were never enough to justify the change to CE/BCE even back then. This is of course because, as mentioned earlier, WP:ERA requires that article-specific reasons be given and consensus established. Neither occured then. What we see from 2012 can at best be called a disgrace; it was merely Dougweller and his friends making the laughably fallacious and tendentious claim that because there were more of them, they should automatically get their way without having to justify their case or convince anyone of it. The """"discussion"""" went quiet in its unresolved state and the change from the Queen's English (which the article has used since its creation and the overwhelming majority of the time since then) to CE/BCE therefore didn't proceed, at least until 20 months later when Mzilikazi decided to try again, this time without any attempt to follow the proper procedure.

If Mzilikazi and his friends want to legitimately change Aesop from the established English language abbreviations to CE/BCE then by all means discuss it here and follow the proper process. Stop trying to ram through your illegal change with constant back and forth editing. (  )""",0,0,0,0,0,0

Advice
To save me writing too much, a lot of this is going to be links to existing policies and guidelines - there is plenty of advice available, in fact a confusing amount, so pointers may be helpful. The guide to writing Your First Article and the Business' FAQ are particularly useful.

Wikipedia frowns on writing about your own organisation because of worries that someone with a conflict of interest will not be able to write from the Neutral Point of View which is one of our three key content policies. (The others are Verifiability and No Original Research). However, the anonymity of account names means it can't be prohibited, and it may be better to have a declared interest than somone pushing a case anonymously.

It should be possible for you to write an article about your organisation that won't get deleted, if you are careful. The first essential is to avoid any hint of promotion - be drily factual, as though you were unconnected with the organisation and had no interest in it, but were documenting it for completeness. See the guideline on peacock terms.

The next point is likely to be the problem if your organisation is new - notability, which is the Wikipedia term for """"of enough general interest for an encyclopedia article"""". See the guidelines on Notability and Notability (organisations and companies). What you have to do is find references from reliable sources which are independent of you. Your own web-site etc are not considered independent. Has there been comment on your organisation, e.g. in the trade press? It may be that you will have to wait until you are more established and can cite independent references.

I wrote the above off-line: now that I come to post it, I see you have run into another problem - copyright. That's more of a problem than you might think, because everything in WP must released under the """"GFDL"""" which says that anyone may do anything with it including rework it for commercial use - so just saying """"I agree to this being put in"""" is not enough. The notice above tells you what you can do, but for the reasons in my third para above it is very likely that your mission statement will not be in suitable terms for Wikipedia, so the solution to the copyright problem may well be to rewrite it. That leads me to a last warning: an important difference between Wikipedia and a business directory is that you will not own your article - see WP:OWN - other people can and will edit it. See the warning at the bottom of the page you use to edit: """"If you don't want your writing to be edited mercilessly or redistributed for profit by others, do not submit it.""""

(Studies done by Masters & Johnson, however, have shown that only about 10% of women actually have orgasms through vaginal stimulation alone.) [citation needed] Masturbation aids such as a vibrator, dildo or Ben Wa balls can also be used to stimulate the vagina and clitoris. Many women will caress the breasts or stimulate a nipple with the free hand. Anal stimulation is also enjoyed by some because of the thousands of sensitive nerve endings located there.
Lubrication is sometimes used during masturbation, especially when penetration is involved, but this is by no means universal and many women find their natural lubrication sufficient—some even produce more lubricant alone than with a partner, though the reasons for this seem to be primarily psychological.
Women may masturbate in the bathtub, shower and hot tub, sometimes including the use of warm running water to stimulate the clitoris. Common positions include lying on back or face down, sitting, squatting, or even standing. Lying face down, one may straddle a pillow, the corner or edge of the bed, a partner's leg or some scrunched-up clothing and """"hump"""" the vulva and clitoris against it. Standing up, the corner of an item of furniture, or even a washing machine, can be used to stimulate the clitoris through the labia and clothing.

A vibrating duck. By de-dramatising the nature of a vibrator, this kind of toy has gained wider acceptance.
Some reach orgasm merely by crossing their legs tightly and clenching the muscles in their legs, which creates pressure on the genitals. This can potentially be done in public without observers noticing. Some prefer to use only pressure, applied to the clitoris without direct contact, for example by pressing the palm or ball of the hand against underwear or other clothing.
A few women can orgasm spontaneously, after experiencing prior sexual arousal, due to intellectual stimulation alone, for instance listening to certain pieces of music. Often, these mental triggers have associations with previous instances of arousal and orgasm. Some women claim to be able to orgasm spontaneously by force of will alone, but that ability, if it exists at all, may not strictly qualify as masturbation as no physical stimulus is involved.
Those who have difficulty reaching orgasm through sexual intercourse may find it easier to achieve an orgasm through masturbation. Sometimes sex therapists will recommend that female patients take time to masturbate to orgasm, especially if they have not masturbated before """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Parkwells, yes, I went to the source you referred/linked to regarding other visitors to Monticello and they had this to say: These family members are not mentioned in Thomas Jefferson’s Farm Book(7) as being visitors to Monticello (The Farm Book does not appear to be a log of visitors, but lists an accounting of his plantations, e.g. livestock, land, crops, costs, and slaves.) 'Not a logbook of visitors.' Hardly compelling.Schulz, your notion that Hyland's book has 'been ignored by scholars' simply because it is not mentioned at the cite you linked to is ridiculous, esp since it has indeed been endorsed by many scholars, including former members of the TJF. Hyland is Adjunct Professor at Stetson University, College of Law, at Tampa Bay, Florida. If you think that Hyland is dead, why don't you send him an email / WHYLAND@travelers.com and see how he feels about that. You have the wrong Hyland. Hyland's book came out in 2009, the Hyland you're referring to died in 2008. Please do you homework. And if you are ready to dismiss a source because of two spelling errors it is clear that your mind is quite closed and simply can't come to terms with the idea that there are a whole body of historians, professors, who exist outside of the box you seem to have enclosed yourself in.

You're right that speed cameras and lowered speed limits are an excellent way of taking the glamour out of motoring, and I fully support them for that reason despite the temporary rise in accidents that they cause.  In the long run, as people are made to use sustainable, safer transport, this policy will save far more lives than it costs, and so I can't see how anyone but the most militant, reckless petrolhead would oppose it.

I'm too busy to pool resources for the moment, but I will be adding some pages to my site in the near future about this important topic, and I will announce here when I have done so.  I am also thinking about setting up a separate campaign site to make people aware of this often-overlooked benefit of cameras and other anti-car measures.  But we need to be careful because as you say, it's necessary to operate in """"stealth mode"""" for the moment and pretend that the cameras/limits/etc are for short-term safety in order to stop Daily Wail readers and selfish cagers from moaning about being endangered by them (their deaths would arguably be beneficial to humanity, but that's another discussion).

I would also encourage you to subscribe to uk.rec.cycling.moderated, which has been set up in part to stop cagers from pointing out the dangers presented by cameras (although technically correct, such arguments are disallowed on URCM in the interest of long-term road safety, which is clearly a good thing; it was difficult to oppose those arguments on uk.rec.cycling, which frustrated some of us, hence the need for uk.rec.cycling.moderated in order to suppress them).

Do you think this confirms the existence of unfermented kimchi against all sources I gathered? Someone might like to have a bite of Sauerkraut before it is fermented. 
I don't want to argue with you or something, but I have heard that beer is made from only malt, hops, and water in Germany (as it should be). Unfortunately, at least in Korea, Japan, and the U.S., most beer includes rice, potato, corn starch, and many other ingredients I think unnecessary. At least they have ingredient lists on the bottles, and there are a lot of official documents on those additional ingredients.
But kimchi is a different story. Like I said, I have never seen any packaged/jarred kimchi labeled """"unfermented"""", maybe except for Japanses """"kimuchi"""" which is more like pickled vegetables. And both traditional and contemporary kimchi is fermented. (they are not much different anyway.) Nevertheless, I am willing to temper my claim if editors can find even a couple of reliable sources that say some kimchi is unfermented.

How about someone ends the """"Split..."""" section with a closing paragraph about Scott leaving and then they form a new section titled something like: """"Rumored replacement singers"""" or something like that.

It is easier to find names rather than searching through a section of the article that doesnt even have a title relevant to the fact that VR is looking for a new singer...

I am ambivalent about the old meme reference in this section that the below poster complains about.  However, I do have a real criticism:

The line """"here are good evolutionary reasons to expect humans to find juvenile humans, and perhaps juvenile animals in general, cute."""" should definitly either expound on the alluded-to """"good reasons"""", or at the least link to somewhere in wikipedia where these reasons are enumerated and explained.

-B. McGrauw (not logged in)

I think the whole perceptions of cuteness section should be removed to improve the focus of the article. What things people find cute and possible reasons for that is an interesting question, but it is an anthropological question and serves only to muddle this article.

In any case, the """"Every time you masturbate..."""" joke should be removed. It was popular among internet humorists for a while, but not really worthy of note outside of its own article; also, it is an off color joke and goes completely against the tone of the rest of the article.

Any thoughts?
 
Hey.. i was looking for imformation on how to take care of abandoned kittens and came acrossed the discussion board.. i cant believe like a page was devoted to whether or not an article should linked on the page.. who really cares... i hope yas rnt losing sleep over it...(n)... i dunt mean to sound like a biotch... but its boring to read about all the complaints... and the point of the board is to write about cats/kittens.. atleast thats what the impression i got .. could b wrong though (anon)

The reference to the """"Every time you masturbate..."""" joke should be removed. It does nothing to enhance the article. And every time some kid looks up kitten on wikipedia, a parent has to answer questions about masturbation. It's offensive, if nothing else.  

In response to the first anon, this page is actually for discussion on how the article can be improved. Some off-topic comments are usually tolerated but long discussion threads are generally seen as disruptive.
In response to Wabazana, Wikipedia is not censored for the protection of minors. However, I do agree that this particular reference is a bit of a systemic bias towards nerdy references. I've boldly changed it to refer to Hello Kitty (which was already in 'see also'), which I think we can agree is going to be more familiar to the average reader.  

Lovely though it is, is """"perceptions of cuteness"""" really encyclopaedic?   
Well, it's interesting. It's written in a neutral point of view. And as regards verifiability, if 'kittens are cute' isn't common knowledge, then I don't know what is. So yes, I for one think it's encyclopaedic.  ( T | C | A ) 

I read about the '""""perceptions of cuteness"""" discussion on the wiki kitten page in the Wall Street Journal, Wed. August 15th edition, and was thrilled. The cuteness of kittens/cats is one of my favorite subjects, to the annoyance of everyone who knows me. I do agree with another poster's comment that the pics of the kittens on this page aren't necessarily the best. Feel free to use this picture of my kitten PJ.  http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Pj_blinds.jpg

Re  NEAVE. It is a great pity that the disputants have failed to draw the right lessons from the Neave quotations on this page. These passages do not teach us anything about Rosenberg. They do not even teach us something about Hitler. Hitler's words, private and official, about Rosenberg reflect the attitude of every strongman everywhere towards the philosophy that he puts to his use. If Hitler would have had a DIFFERENT attitude towards Rosenberg and his philosophy, THAT would have been noteworthy. The same goes for the quip about the U-boat crews. It tells us a lot about books but nothing about Rosenberg's book.

This is an oooold subject/section here, but I agree, the highly detailed diagram is quite scary-looking to a novice reader, and much more complicated than the basics of the topic. Start with something simpler, since there are certainly simpler aspects of diffraction than multislit-with-vectors. File:Wave Diffraction 4Lambda Slit.png would certainly be an improvement (simpler case, still a pretty picture that clearly illustrates some key ideas). I think that diagram would be even better if the barrier/slit were actually visible clearly rather than just another thin black line in a parallel field of black lines: consider either File:Difraction.png or File:Difrakce sterbina bodova.png. Somewhat related, seems like there is no navbox for the wave-phenomena articles. Having a directory of the reflection, refraction, diffraction, interferences, etc. main articles would be a great way to tie together all these pages and help students work through/among them.   20:14",0,0,0,0,0,0

Double Standard reloaded
Who is interested in debating and who is not?
Who is interested in developing the article and
who is interested in freezin it to death, including using threats and veiled censorship in the form of selective double standard applying of internal rules?

After all, it never too much to remind that:
an editor besides not been unwilling or unable to counter argue, over a year and a half, he also have done baseless statements about editions done by me in a certain rude tone,
During all this time, I have responded to him in the same mode, but especifically to these assertions,
not having any left unanswered, unlike him...
...and only me is who was warned and blocked
Curious...
  

""""Summary of operations""""
To the newcomers in this discussion and also to the selective forgetful ones:

See above The heart of this Case;
As well as the sections Spurious Quotations, Once Again, and sections Warning to Judge by yourselves II in my Talk Page;

To note that 
1) from grammatical objections to the size of version that I propose, no one objection was left standing and even so it continues to be reversed, 
even taking into account that the present version: 
incurs spurious quote in the 1st paragraph, 
too detailed and redundant information (for an article that are supposed to be short...) on the 2nd paragraph, 
and incomplete besides be longer, vague and non neutral in the 3rd...

2) How not to think in double standard when:

The last disruptive revertion, besides be longer than the version I propose, was based entirely on incorrect inferences and historical misconceptions as I shown above (again... See above points A to E in """"Once Again"""" section ) that were related only to the 2nd paragraph (of the version I propose);
and that
No word was uttered against or about the spuriousness that was purged of the 1st paragraph, as well as against or about the 3rd paragraph, that according to some editor (Ctr F on word """"solid"""" to see above, on the discussion about grammar in the """"Once Again"""" section), was """"pretty solid""""...

And even so, the revertion was done...

So, I again ask you all:

1) Is the spuriousness justifiable under any circunstances?

2) In the case of an encyclopedia that is intended to be free and neutral, which group of honest editors would admit the use of partial referrals that lead to political and historical inferences in favor of a political regime (monarchical, military, etc.) whatever be?

Worse, which group of honest editors would allow the use of spurious citations of a partial source for purposes mentioned above - even if this purposes are involuntary, although the time that passed without actions having been taken, as well as the resistance to remediation maintained, only makes this possibility (of involuntariness) unlikely???

3) Which group of honest editors, ladies and gentlemen, who were truly committed to the freedom and neutrality of such instrument, would vote against such remediation or would omit about it?

Agreed. I amended the article after the chessbase article came out. I think it's only fair to report it, without endorsing or refuting the possibility that Topalov did, in fact, cheat. Dionyseus has never understood the difference between saying, """"Topalov was accused of cheating"""" and """"Topalov cheated"""", so it is possible that he will now delete my edit, arguing that Topalov didn't cheat. It's frustrating and time consuming, arguing with characters like that. And while I had plenty of passive support last year, I'd appreciate some more active support for inclusion this time around, should Dionyseus choose to make another big stink. Apparently, Dionyseus interprets neutrality as the censorship of negative information, no matter how factual. Of course, this is the same guy who, last year, edited Kramnik's article so that it started with a list of his match losses. Of course, I wouldn't want to infringe upon wiki's tradition of love, charity, and respect; so, I feel I should clarify my position insofar as I absolutely DO NOT regard Dionyseus to be 1) a blight on wikipedia, 2) a mental degenerate, 3) incapable of lucid reasoning, or 4) incapable of language use. He is certainly none of those things. And admins may take that as an official statement.  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Do you know the superracist """"Sinanoglu Youth Movement"""" in Turkey? Do you know that some Wikipedia Users are doing valdalism by showing themselves as the advocates of the Five Pillars of Wikipedia ? 

Sinanoglu is not only a chemist, the """"moreover"""" and """"the"""" more important, he is the icon of the """"Turk Superracism"""". The person who is subject of that article (Oktay Sinanoglu) published autobiographical book in 2001 in Turkey by using the fake titles of the “World’s Youngest Professor”, “Lord of U.S.A”, “at the peak point of science in U.S.A”, “The Turkish Einsten” etc. so he gained a lot of prestige in Turkey and a few million Turkish student accepted him as their idol and having been believed the fake titles of Sinanoglu are exactly true they occured the “Sinanoglu Youth Movement”. The last ten year (2001 – 2011) Sinanoglu became the “Hero of People” by using these fake titles that he published them in his bestseller autobiographical book. Today, by contributing a few million college student, the “Sinanoglu Youth Movement” was like the superracist “Hitler Youth Movement” in Turkey and Sinanoglu became the icon of the """"Turk Superracism"""" everywhere. By reading the autobiographical book of Sinanoglu, large amount of college students became “superracist Turks” under the influence of Sinanoglu’s megalomanic and fake titles. So, they are conducting the election campaign: “Sinanoglu must be the President of The Republic of Turkey!” Eight years ago, the first edition of this article was written by some members of “Sinanoglu Youth Movement” as the summary of Sinanoglu’s autobiographical book and this Wikipedia article was used by them in Turkey as the proof that the titles of Sinanoglu had been accepted as exactly true by whole world, so every Turk must believe that this titles of Sinanoglu was exactly true. That was the begining and the developing of the """"Sinanoglu Youth Movement"""" in Turkey. Did you understand now why I was interested and why I am working to edit this article by using verifiable documents over 200 references? Please look at the edit history of the article. You will see a lot of vandal attacks to clean my editings. The last vandal attacks came from “Salvador21”-“Khazar2”-“Bobrayner” If you look at these users pages, you will see that these users are Turks and they are related with “Ottoman Empire” articles in wikipedia and they advocated “New-Ottomanist Imperialist Ideology” that Sinanoglu propagated this ideology in his autobiographic book. As a result, the some members of the superracist """"Sinanoglu Youth Movement"""" cleaned the all words of the article which is writen by me and they provided to put blockage to my editings by showing themselves advocates of the Wikipedia Five Pillars. The “Sinanoglu Youth Movement” are in joy that Wikipedia blocked my editings. And now, they sing a song: “Long Live the Five Pillars of Wikipedia!

Addition of """"YLOD"""" has been discussed here in the past and the main reason it hasn't been included is that there weren't any reliable, notable sources discussing it.

I don't know if this is still the case but as far as I know, the problem hasn't been widely reports by the likes of Gamespot, 1UP, Gamasutra, etc. People have suggested that it should be included because RROD is mentioned on the Xbox articles and the response to that has been that while YLOD is known among PS3 users, it isn't nearly on the scale of RROD which was very widely reported on in both the gaming and mainstream media and it's notability has therefore not been so strongly established.

Unless the entire list or at least the tetrapod-like traits are reliably sourced (e.g. """"Smith (2001) lists these 11 traits as key tetrapod characteristics"""") the appearance is that you alone are advancing the view that all of these species and/or their traits are remarkable for their supposed tetrapod-like nature; assertions which may never have been explicitly made in reliable sources, and thus the list appears to be original synthesis.  The facts themselves are certainly appropriate in each species' article, but combining them in a novel fashion to reach a conclusion(?) unsupported by sources is synthesis.

 Clarification 

Posted from User talk:IZAK#Meshullam Gross  
Hi IZAK, thanks for that neat move of Nachlas Tzvi. Only two issues - one fairly significant.

1.If you want to be pedantic, he actually went by the English name of Herman Gross. Meshulam Tzvi was his Hebrew name and used in his Seforim.
2.Technically speaking and according to the information availible to me, he was NOT a Rabbi. Apparently (or so I've been told), he was offered Semicha many times and was certainly able, but never accepted it.
Therefore, I deliberately refrained from placing him in any Rabbi category, let alone the Haredi category. Off the point since he wasnt a Rabbi, I object to terming him """"Haredi"""" as the boundaries in his age were fluid and the word wasnt even used. Indeed, by todays standards he may not have been """"Haredi"""" (whatever that irksome term means). Many thanks,  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Using the Droop Quota of 51, neither party reaches the quota, but as they have the same number of first preference votes, neither can be eliminated; and we have a tie anyway.

I feel your behaviour on this matter is bordering on inappropriate, specifically that you are assuming an authority on dictating procedure that is not in any way supported by policy.   Swordfish made that revert on the basis of wanting reliable sourcing (he had not followed the wikilinks included in the added text to see that the point is more than adequately sourced and not at all controversial); I directed him to those sources and he has made no objection to my reintroducing the content so far.  The fact that I made my case in an edit summary is utterly irrelevant  there is no policy requiring me to start a superfluous talk page entry as opposed to making the sources known through any other venue or means of discussion on the project.    And in approaching the matter in this way, I in no way violated the principle of WP:Consesus, to which I am fully committed as an editor; had Swordfish reverted again, I would have opened a discussion on the article's talk page, but it's not your place to just assume his reaction to my new evidence and insist on a particular course of action in resolving the (non)issue between the two of us.  Your actions in this case, and especially your tone in your edit summaries, seem to suggest that you feel you are in a position to dictate the methodologies of other editors with regard to work flow and communication, but in this case you have no policy argument to support this behaviour and no special position in the community entitling you to interfere in this manner, especially when you had no reason to believe the matter was not already dealt with to the satisfaction of the original parties involved.

a460535b0a6cae9e,"Reply to FyzixFighter 

FyzixFighter, you are making some of the same mistakes as Brews. You seem to think that we can take that four part expansion of acceleration in terms of polar coordinates and read some physics into it. We can't. The polar terms tell us nothing about any particular motion.

But they are nevertheless very useful. We can use the expressions in a properly modelled differential equation that involves real physical input. The radial convective term is used as a centrifugal force in the two body gravity problem.

You seem to think that because it is derived with a negative sign that it has to mean centripetal force. That is not so. The negative sign is a consequence of the outward positive convention for the position vector.

The expression is merely the mathematical form for a force that changes the direction of motion and acts in the radial direction.

When we construct the planetary orbital equation, we end up with a radial gravity force inwards and a centrifugal force radially outwards. We have a scalar equation in the radial length and the two forces equate to the second time derivative of the radial length. You have got too much bogged down in trivia over matters like whether or not the second time derivative of radial length is entitled to be termed radial acceleration or not.

It doesn't matter. Just concentrate on the equation and solve it. And in doing so, you will see that inward radial gravity is working in opposition to an ongoing outward radial centrifugal force.",0,0,0,0,0,0
a4c0b68fbe539aaa,"""

 What is a """"scalar force""""?  

At the start of the current article there appears a list of pointers to other article, and the last item on the list says """"For the scalar force that appears in polar coordinates, see the article on polar coordinates"""". I checked the article on polar coordinates, and the word """"scalar"""" doesn't appear there. So, what exactly IS a """"scalar force""""? And why does the article point to another article for explanation of something that isn't even mentioned in the other article? Surely something is amiss.63.24.61.29  
Of course, you are correct in pointing out the absurdity of a """"scalar"""" force. This pointer should be removed altogether, but I have only edited it to remove the absurdity. The history of this article shows that this pointer was a concession to a long, drawn out battle that apparently exhausted all parties and led to this compromise.   
Any single dimension is a scalar- a scalar is simply a single number. There's nothing absurd about a scalar force any more than there is about a scalar acceleration. What is 9.81 m/s^2?- () WolfKeeper (Talk) 

I don't understand the """"corrected"""" version. The acceleration component that it refers to (i.e., the one that arises in stationary polar coordinates) is explicitly described and given the name """"centrifugal force"""" in countless reputable references, including:

(1) """"An Introduction to the Coriolis Force"""" By Henry M. Stommel, Dennis W. Moore, 1989 Columbia University Press. 
(2) """"Methods of Applied Mathematics"""" By Francis B. Hildebrand, 1992, Dover, p 156.
(3) """"Statistical Mechanics"""" By Donald Allan McQuarrie, 2000, University Science Books. 
(4) """"Essential Mathematical Methods for Physicists"""" By Hans-Jurgen Weber, George Brown Arfken, Academic Press, 2004, p 843.

 This has been pointed out previously, with the relevant quotations. I don't think there can be any dispute of the fact that this particular acceleration term is indeed among the terms that are called (in contemporary reputable sources) centrifugal force. Needless to say, it's entirely a matter of convention as to what names we give certain terms appearing in certain equations, but since Wikipedia articles are supposed to reflect verifiable facts from reputable sources, I can't see any justification for excluding this particular fact from the article. I think any discussion of the contemporary (let alone the historical) concept of centrifugal force is incomplete if it doesn't include this. 

There are also other concepts that go under the name """"centrifugal force"""" but that are not yet mentioned in this article. And conversely, there are lots of things discussed at length in this article that are only indirectly related to the concept of centrifugal force. I understand that much of this material has been added as part of a tutorial on general physics being given to placate some of the editors here, but ultimately I think it detracts from the readibility and relevance of the article. 

Overall I think the present article has evolved into a lengthy set of notes that various people have made as they clarified in their own minds certain aspects and implications of the centrifugal force, as they responded to challenges from certain other editors. Sort of learning on the job. That's a commendable exercise, but it doesn't make for a very coherent article, and frankly, the",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Is everything kosher, and Sophia is ready to be WP:BOLD in mainspace now?  
 As I understand it, Phil her manager in the UK *is* still blocked, save from editing his own talkpage to discuss unblocking procedures. 
 Due to tech-related difficulties with inability to type colons (perhaps he edits from a tablet with no physical keyboard?), and because he did some impersonation of Sophia and some creation of new usernames for evasion-and-or-socking, Phil may need to wait for the Usual Six Months prior to requesting an unblock of his User:Welshmusiclover account, should he wish to return to wikipedia and get himself back into wikipedian-in-good-standing status.  
 I believe that Sophia can, if she so wishes, give Phil some pointers on the wiki-rules, and on the use of talkpages, and other such topics, which will immensely improve Phil's chances of getting his own username unblocked.  
 But they should both read WP:MEATPUPPET very carefully, so that they don't cross the wiki-rules against socking and puppetry and making edits on behalf of other people.  
 Sophia should exclusively use her own newly-cleansed user-account User:Sophia Giroux-Radisch, and not only should nobody else use it directly, nobody else should use it *indirectly* either.  
 On the other reason for her old user-account and Phil's current user-account being blocked, Sophia should be aware at all times that wikipedia is not a vehicle for self-promotion.  
 This includes herself, her albums, her movies, and so on, plus also her other clients and her co-workers at rock Solid Talent Entertainment (not to mention the corporate entity itself), as well as her relatives and friends.  
 She should remember the rules of WP:COI and WP:SPIP, and stick to making suggestions on the article-talkpages or in draftspace, if she ever wishes to see edits made, related to herself or her workplace.  
 Admins, is this advice all correct, and is there any other advice that Sophia needs to hear, before she goes on her merry way?

69082355e78359b1,"Network proxies are used for a number of reasons. There is the type that many organizations use to limit what their employees (or students, etc.) have access to, which is the reason you and your coworkers do not have access to Facebook or Gmail. They can also speed up access to websites and reduce the amount of internet traffic by caching or storing copies of pages that are frequently accessed. Normally, the proxy software is configured so that only users inside the network have access to it. In this case, however, it is misconfigured so that everyone inside and outside the network can access it. The effect is that anyone, anywhere in the world, can appear to be a user on your company's network. People often access this type or proxy for privacy reasons, but they are most often used as a gateway to send spam, to launch network attacks, to facilitate viruses and trojan horse attacks, and, sadly, to vandalize Wikipedia articles, which is the reason we automatically block them.

But to get back to your questions: I have no way of knowing when the IP address began acting as an open proxy, but it appears that it was detected and blocked by an automated process here on October 22, 2011. And, no, most organizations do not employ open proxies due to the security concerns I mentioned above. It appears that the IP address has not been included in any anti-spam blacklists yet, but if you run a Google search for it, you will see that there are some indications of trouble. Most network admins would be very glad to hear about this sort of issue before the IP address appears on blacklists gets blocked by their own or other internet providers.

I hope this clears it up for you, but feel free to ask more questions if not. Cheers ​— ​",0,0,0,0,0,0

Hi!

I'm writing to let you know that the Wikimedia Board of Trustees has approved the first stage of the Wikinews project. There's now a fully operational English demo site at demo.wikinews.org. This will be used for experimenting with various review models and basic policies before the site is launched officially in about a week. demo.wikinews.org will become the English version later.
 
You voted for the Wikinews project, so I'm asking for your participation now. Everything is open, nothing is final. What Wikinews will and can be depends in large part on you. There already is a global Wikinews mailing list for discussing the project. If you are interested at all, please subscribe  coordination is of key importance. There's also an IRC channel #wikinews on irc.freenode.net. Realtime discussion can help to polish up articles.
 
If you're looking for something to do, check out the articles in development and articles in review. Or start a new story in the Wikinews workspace, or ignore the proposed review system - it's up to you. I hope you'll join us soon in this exciting experiment. 01:59, Nov 17, 2004 (UTC)",0,0,0,0,0,0

Well, it does have some issues, so it seems.   First, I moved out one of the sentences that mentioned her ranking by NewsMax as a GOP figure.  I placed that to the other section about criticism and praise.  But, now there's just these two other sentences.   And they're really just dealing with her public appearances, which we've considered before… in fact, we eliminated them a while ago, if you see prior notes. See this Talk Page, where we mention that prior section once called """"Through all this time, Fiorina has appeared…""""  Remember that? We questioned the paragraph(s) and their citations and relevance.  Eventually it was eliminated. That's probably becasuse she's not unlike most public figures, that make many, many appearances through their lifetime.  That section has been gone a while now, seemingly without objection.  I'm guessing that's because most of us have agreed that we're not going to cite every appearance a public figure has made.  If its significant or exceptional, surely we can mention it.  But, now however, I'm wondering about a very short section that's currently titled Advocate at large.  That's since its become whittled down to two sentences, one of which is questionable.  I've actually found she may have appeared at Ripon several times.  But, to play devil's advocate… So what?  Republicans appear at crowds of conservative groups, Democrats before liberal groups, Greens before their own…. and so on.  Therefore, I question how exceptional this should be regarded.  By the way second sentence mentions """"National Press Club"""" as mentioned in the article.  But this Wikipedia article is attributing that to a Press club although it reads as """"National Press Club.""""  It's not particular to National Press Club (United States), which I'm not quick to assume, since the disambiguation the source (named in the citation) ambiguously calls it """"the National Press Club.""""  Again… appearing before THE National Press Club of the U.S. is not all that exceptional.  They invite notable dignitaries all the time… whoever, whatever party… etc.  Again, so what?   I wouldn't be surprised if The Club has invited most of the presidential candidates, if not had some of them speak in prior events, before they became candidates. So, I'm almost at the point of wanting to eliminate this entire section.  Any comments?   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

As an objective third party, I can most definitely say that the current iteration of the article is quite biased towards the associated risks and not the device/procedure itself.  As a relatively new Wikipedian I came upon this article to see what all has been written about a subject I've been curious about for some time now, what I found was an article that has been butchered by people with agendas.  Why is it that an overwhelmingly large portion of the article is about the risks of Silicone breast implants when most implants used today are saline?  Why is there absolutely no information about why women get implants?  I would be more than happy to help expand these subjects but I believe it will be quite pointless until those with agendas have moved on, or take their discussion on the controversy of breast implants to the proper page. aktornado",0,0,0,0,0,0

The newspaper article that I read was about the Edwards campaign.  If I write about that, it would be potentially biased because all of them are doing it, not just Edwards.

I see what you are saying but in my view Trinity and Aquinas are apart of each-other (hence why i reposted them). eg. AC is apart of TC because AC is TC's boarding school, and TC is a part of AC because TC is AC's Day School (if that makes sense). That was the idea when they made them, AC = boarders and TC = day kids. So in my view they are apart of each other? 

Maybe it is just the way I am looking at the topic at hand? im too 'personalised' with it?

Ok, So is it just my view of the topic OR am i completely screwed up on this entire thing.

 that, if a consensus was displayed, it was as you describe.
I think that the argument supported the original complaint:
""""==NPOV - Murder vs killing ==
There seems to be a bizarre NPOV inconsistency being raised over articles relating to people killed in Ireland. There are (1) victims of IRA / PIRA such as 86 year old Sir Norman Stronge, 8th Baronet and James Stronge; (2) victims of Loyalists such as Pat Finucane (solicitor), (3) “victims” of the British army such as Kieran Fleming; and (4) suicides such as Bobby Sands. There is a vocal and persistent lobby which is pro Irish Republican, many of whom belong to Wikipedia:WikiProject_Irish_Republicanism, which argues (I think) that a death is a killing until somebody is found guilty of murder even when that killing is generally defined and established as murder by law and in the international press.""""...(kiwiexile at DMOZ)  • """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Cristina,

Am I allowed to wish you a Happy Valentine's day, or is that verboten?!

Anyway, how are things? Have you moved into the new apartment yet? If not when? I'm really looking forward to paying you a visit and seeing it for myself - and of course you and Kerim! Don't forget when you are settled to send me some pics of the place.

You asked about Connie and Elvira. They are both well thanks. Tomorrow Connie will visit her parents for a couple of weeks to celebrate the New Year. It must be amazing to be in China for their New Year - it is such a big event. I know travelling and hotels in China at this time is a nightmare, but I still think it would be an unforgettable experience. Maybe next year..  Life in Peru is good; no news though. I'll phone Elvira this afternoon and then see her on messenger this evening after German. Are you and Kerim going to do anything special today? Romantic meal with wine and candles, followed by a quiet walk under a moonlit sky?! Or will he come home late from work, drunk and with lipstick on his collar?  ;-)

Is next Monday a bank holiday for you? It is here but I'm not too sure what to do. Claire has invited me to Lake Constance, something I need to think about. Or I could spend three days studying German -(  Blöödy German. If Europe wants one common currency, then why not also one common language? (Not French - Sorry Kerim!) To be honest I don't like my German lessons. The teaching format is, for me, very unconventional. There is very little reading and writing - almost nothing. Instead we are 'supposed' to learn through talking and repeating. While I know this will be perfect for some, not everyone can learn in this way. I sure you know the three ways people learn: aural, visual and kinestic. Well I know I'm a mixture of visual and kinestic. And when it comes to learning a language I have to see it written on paper, write it several times and actually use the words. Also she, the teacher, is not supposed to talk in English. Which begs the question how can she explain something complex without explaining to us in our own language. OK, enough moaning about German!

Thankfully I am not suffering from spending yesterday evening in the gym. I am hoping that I become addicted to the place and that I *have* to go to get my 'fix'. Tomorrow I have a fitness assessment which will be interesting. Next week will be the induction and I shall be given a program to follow. They also have lots of classes which is one of the reasons I chose to join this gym. Along with the muscle/fitness classes they also have more relaxing classes: yoga, pilates, etc. which I quite like. I find listening/understanding the class instructor hard enough in English, so to do it in German will be amusing! The gym I go to is in the centre but there is one closer to my home; not too sure how to get there though. Elvira wasn't pleased when I told her the showers and saunas are mixed! You know how jealous those latinas are ;-)

OK, time for me to leave you in peace. Please give my greetings to all and you take care. I shall be in touch again soon.

In the image caption of the Minkowski addition (and anywhere else), only mathematical variables should be italicized. For example Q1+Q2=[1,3]×[1,3] should be Q1+Q2=[1,3]×[1,3].

On Wikipedia, our job is to provide material backed by reliable and verifiable sources. I don't doubt that Arcamax Publishing may well be sending spam to you, but this edit, where it is described as """"Arcamax spam is worse than a bad case of the crabs."""" is pure opinion.

I had now been contacted by the administrator pjacobi on the talk page of user Harald88. I have interpreted his message such that there is no objection against me writing a new article.

If a certain article has been deleted because of violations against the neutrality requirements etc. then this can hardly mean that the theme Galilean relativity shall be banned altogether! This is what Philosophus would like, isn't it, Philosophus?

If I should be wrong in this respect, then the administrators should let me know. As matter of fact, in that case I would not supply further contributions.

 Promotional writing and non-free content 

The tone of this article is not factual and neutral, but comes across as a promotional brochure aimed at people who belong to to Lee's particular denomination or doctrine of Christianity. Cases in point: """"Lee knows that Christians lives are to be holy and should be empowered by the Holy Spirit"""",  """"Rev. Dr. Lee movingly testified to messages"""", """"...the fiery and explosive work of the Holy Spirit..."""", """"Blind eyes were opened to see and ears that could not hear came to hear"""" - those are a very few examples of utterly inappropriate and unencyclopedic phrases that abound in this text.  Add to this the fact that this article seems to make the claim that Lee can actually perform miracles of healing, in direct contravention of Wikipedia policies.  In addition, criticism and counter arguments have been removed or whitewashed, sometimes to the point of saying the exact opposite of what the sources state.

The article needs a lot of work by people who are not affiliated with Lee's organisation. At the moment, there are many editors who work only on articles connected to Lee and his work, and it seems probable that there is a strong conflict of interest here.

Another important issue is to do with non-free content. Bits of the promotional blurbs of Lee's books, and text taken straight from press releases, have been pasted into the article. It's difficult to find all the individual instances, because they crop up everywhere, and that's a very big problem. '''' contributions talk """,0,0,0,0,0,0

I think 1ragincajun's question was more concerned than just wondering about what is possible or not. In Wikipedia film articles I've come across ridiculous, tiny detail by detail plot synopses from beginning right through to the very end. And, yes, that's 'allowable', but can be very annoying to many. The problem further is that then there may be no real in depth discussion of the film beyond giving the structure of the plot away, leaving a shallow, spoiling article.

So I was a bit relieved to find the current Norwegian Wood synopsis.  It doesn't seem to have been suggested much, though ideal would be for films to have a separate full plot Wikipedia page, containing the full synopses first also. It would leave it possible for people who haven't seen a film to read the main film article page without having to learn of what happens through to the end.

Anyway, ideally, I agree with 1ragincajun. Isn't it possible to be a bit more vague about the development, including something like - 'the hero's life develops with these 2 love interests in an emotionally tight film involving tragedy'? Just a thought.",0,0,0,0,0,0

1. Added some info in the ethics section on moral philosophy adequately considered. 
2.  Rewrote the criticism section. The quote from Gilson second handedly attributing an opinion to Fr. Balzic that Maritain would be condemned as a heretic seems irrelevant. It is an opinion of contemporary and not from the source. In its place I've added a list of some of the main criticisms that come up in the literature with references.

The subject homophobia and the definition of the term homophobia are not the same thing. The subject of homophobia is (in short) the fear or hatred of gays, or discrimination or prejudice against them. The AFA is a recognized part of a body of groups, people, and ideas that define modern-day homophobia. There's no way you can deny that, even if you believe that the label is undeserved, that the label could be pejorative in a non-encyclopedic context, or that somehow being categorized under """"homophobia"""" and being an organization somehow equates to being categorized as """"homophobic organization."""" The categories """"homophobic organization"""" and """"homophobe"""" were deleted because they are, grammatically, constructed to specifically modify or describe the subject in question. """"Homophobia"""" is not, and these false analogies may make it seem like we're out go get the AFA, but we aren't. Although Sam seems to think it's an irrelevant personal comment, it is the case, Hal, that since you got here, you've been arguing that the AFA's opinion of itself should more of a part of the article, and that criticism should not be. Miles have been spun about how much of a big deal this is, that we're gay activists, that we're creating attack articles, that the category homophobia is a pejorative attack on whatever it labels. Now, Sam, I know you'll insist on removing this part of my comment (editing/censoring others' comments is a practice that is, by the way, fairly dubious). But remember that we are supposed to discuss the issue at hand, not the character of others - I'm not attacking Hal's character. But his history of editing for the sake of the AFA is completely relevant to this discussion and a part of the issue at hand - it explains why he believes we've constructed an attack article (hardly), why the category is a pejorative attack or accusation (clearly not), and why it must be eventually removed. I agree with Hal: it could be taken as a pejorative, and what concerns me is that it is, but only (as far as I can tell) by someone who's made it clear that portraying the AFA in a positive light is very important (no matter [[WP:UNDUE|what that entails).

Just to give you an idea of the requirements. You need to have, really as a minimum, 250 Mainspage edits, currently you have 32.

 Celine Dion Signings 

Please do not change Celine's signings in the infobox. The infobox should only pertain to signings and not imprints traced to the artist around the world. The reason why Celine was imprinted with Columbia and not Epic in Europe and Canada is because her catalog is actually sold by her original signee, Sony Music Canada, who uses the Columbia label. The content creator on the other hand is pic records up till 2007, and 2007 onward Columbia Records. Columbia Records as a standalone company exists in two places: NYC (original standalone company for many decades) and London (a division of Sony Music UK). Every other """"Sony Music (insert country name here)"""" company uses it as an A&R; imprint, they don't operate actual companies or standalone divisions called Columbia. Celine's first sony affiliate signing was in 1986 to CBS Records Canada, (CBS became Sony globally on jan 1, 1991), and Sony Music Canada used the Columbia logo on her (worked with the """"columbia"""" a&r; team at Sony Canada). Then Celine went on to sign with Sony affiliates in the US, but in the US they operate as standalone companies since there's many of them (there's just not one central """"sony music"""" company). However, even though she signed other sony deals in another country, her original signee (sony music canada) is still the worldwide sales agent of her work, and hence passed along their """"columbia"""" item to europe sony affiliates. Notice in the infobox it indicates she is still on sony music canada, because for as long as she's involved with sony in the US, she is still tied to sony canada. Furthermore, even without this explanation, it is irrelevant what label is used in other markets where the artist isn't signed for the infobox. For example, in Japan, Sony does NOT have the rights to the Columbia trademark, hence every single Sony artist ever, whether Columbia or any other label, was released there with the Epic imprint instead by Sony Music Japan. Does that mean we go to every sony related artist and insert Epic?? Indeed not. """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Wikipedia Neutrality & This Biography Page 

I think it is fairly obvious by now, looking at the enormous amount of commentary over minutia detail over the last few weeks here on Deepak's page, that there is a handful group of editors posting and editing Deepak Chopra's biography here that belong to the Skeptics society and/or are well known Guerilla Skeptics (who have  published videos of their Guerilla tactics on Youtube).  I would not be surprised if some of them are getting well paid for their work.  Their willingness to go to any lengths to ban, harass, or IMO wear-out other contributing editors (who disagree with their view points) and willingness to use whatever tactics they can to promote their Skeptics society Point-of-View of credible scientists like Deepak or Rupert Sheldrake, or Frederic Myers, or Ian Stevenson or even William James, all of which the biographies here on Wikipedia have been modified in a very POV slanted manner (by many of these same small group of editors, sometimes in a very insidious labeling manner, such as calling Deepak Chopra a new-age Guru, or mentioning early on that Ian Stevenson was a """"gullible individual"""" etc.  I really do wonder how Wikipedia can continue to maintain there is any kind of veridical neutrality being practiced here?

I think it would be a good idea to bring in a whole new set of editors (or only allow a new set of editors) come in and rework some of the pages I have mentioned above, without the involvement of the Guerilla Skeptics here.  Perhaps a set of well-known editors that have established themselves on Wikipedia now for many years - could come in, and provide a fair and balanced approach to the biographies of Deepak Chopra, or Rupert Sheldrake, or Ian Stevenson etc.  None of which will be achieved IMO given the obvious agenda that has the foot prints - again of these few, extremely biased and active editors here. 159.118.158.122  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 legends pertaining to Mucalinda 

I have heard and read from several sources a story which elaborates on the Mucalinda legend.  According to this story, the Buddha was pleased with his protector and blessed him by placing a hand on his hood.  As a sign of the Buddha's blessing, cobras bear his fingerprints on their hoods.  Indian or Spectacled cobras (Naja naja) of course have two ocelli or eyespot markings on the back of their hood.  (These are thought to serve as """"eyes in the back of the head,"""" with the adaptive function of deterring predators that might try to attack the standing cobra from behind).  This story may be told in Thailand also, although there is a slight inconsistency in that Thai cobras (Naja kaouthia) have only one spot. )

I have also heard a variant in which the Buddha was protected by the serpent not from rain storms but from the blazing Indian sun.

Unfortunately, I cannot find a decent source for either of these elements in the Mucalinda story and do not know where they originated. 174.111.242.35  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Alan, I'm not sure what you think is compromised ... could you clarify? The core issue we are discussing relates to the template/contents of an Integral portal page that actually reflects the integral movement as it exists. AQAL is one author's (Ken Wilber's) name for his particular developmental model. It is already described in the wikipedia's Ken Wilber article and nobody has suggested that a separate page be added for it. The issue is whether thinkers who call themselves integral and are generally understood and acknowledged as """"integral thinkers"""", doing work that is called """"Integral Studies"""", can simply be identified in the Integral portal page as such, no matter what their particular sect or affinity, (which is all that I have suggested), or whether such thinkers need to be divided a priori into pro-Ken Wilber and anti-Ken Wilber camps, or """"Integral (AQAL)"""" and """"Integral"""", as it seems you may now be proposing. Obviously term AQAL (or even Wilberian for that matter) can be used inoccuously to describe Wilber's own writings. But how does a wikipedia editor decide that a work that calls itself integral (not AQAL) is not suitable for an integral portal page but only an AQAL portal? Even I did so once, as you noted. But it is quite another for a wikipedia editor to declare that certain thinkers or books cannot be linked or acknowledged at an integral portal but only an AQAL portal, based on some subjective interpretation of their use of elements of AQAL theories. I still do not see an answer for whether you would allow Robert Kegan into the integral portal or whether you would insist that he be listed under AQAL only, and I could ask the same question about dozens of writers who cite Wilber as one of many influences. Without a principled and objective answer, I think you are asking wikipedia editors to step into a totally untenable position. As I wrote earlier:
...usually thinkers use some aspect of Wilber's thought combined with the thought of many other sources, seldom use every feature of AQAL, and often disagree about key points. On what basis do you insist that people who call their thought integral actually be considered Wilberian? How much of Wilber's thought must one agree with to be so classified, and who decides? When you acknowledge that a thinker such as Robert Kegan has """"mutually influenced"""" Wilber and yet is part of the integral school of thought, would you propose to create a new Integral portal for such hard-to-classify thinkers, and segregate every thinker that displays too much affinity to Wilber or his model into a separate category, either explicitly called """"Integral theory (Wilberian)"""" or """"Integral theory"""" (but with the Wilberian association implicit, with a wikipedia editor such as yourself presumably determining whether every new thinker is sufficiently anti-Wilber to be listed in the main category)? 
I have not proposed that AQAL be used as a synonym for integral at all, only that any thinker who describes their work as integral and is generally acknowledged as such by independent sources be listed or linked at the integral portal in an appropriate fashion. Since, perhaps, some 90% of thinkers describing themselves as integral today are influenced to one degree or another by Wilber, the consequence of using the term integral in a neutral, objective way as I have proposed may very well be that many themes and ideas treated at the integral portal will be connected to AQAL in some fashion. Again, I will say that in my opinion the right place for your concern about AQAL being inappropriately used as a synonym for integral is in reviewing the content of the pages rather than in denying the usefulness of an integral portal at all.

73b5c74d33d1cf78,I don't understand post signing but I think note 117 ending the section on Justice Verma Commission is very misleading. The findings appear to have been completely sidelined as the women's groups in India maintain. The Finance Minister former Union Sec P Chidambaram openly stated that the cabinet cannot push through the reforms suggested by the Verma Report on AFSPA reform for example because the Army will not allow it. The rushed through new anti-rape ordinances ask for things not found in Verma. Simple directives for medical practitioners to stop the two finger test (it would be called finger fucking in the west but someone will object to the term not the procedure) and then call them forensic reports must be stopped as they are illegal. I accept the Cabinet are making positive noises about it though they are unlikely to accept any of Justice Verma's proposals or adopt the spirit of his reforms ie demanding equal respect for women from low castes tribals and minority indian communities. i am adding four tildas now but I presume that's wrong desmond coutinho,0,0,0,0,0,0

How did you decide that bukkake always implies a female subject? 

Also, just because a word has a historical meaning doesn't mean that it can't ever mean anything else as culture develops. The word rap meant """"to knock, as on a door"""" up until the late 70s for example. Would you deny the more modern use of the term? The English language has no board to regulate it, as French does with the L'Académie française, so you have no basis for defining what the word means. We have groups and documents that define the proper use of words like """"you're"""" and """"your"""", for example, but none such for words like bukkake. If it can be shown that it is used in a particular way, that is valid. My personal belief is that there is no need for the qualifier """"gay"""", just as there is no need to call men having anal sex """"gay anal sex"""", but that's really irrelevent. 

I think it is important to make clear the historical implications, but not to deny that we are currently creating and modifying language. Even the fact that we have taken the word bukkake, """"splash"""", from Japan and created this very specific connotation of splashing not just anything, but specifically semen and specifically onto a person's face shows that this term is elastic and subject not to rules that we impose on it, but by the meaning that it has to the people who use it.

Here are some concerns that I found in the article on a quick run-through:
 resolved Please make sure that the discussion regarding naming is completed and the decision is finalized with consensus one way or the other before you nominate for GA status.
 There are two citation banners in the article, both for lack of inline citations, and both were placed there several months ago.
 resolved There are several sections in the article (Working, utility and assistance dogs, Show and sport (competition) dogs, Dangerous substances) that are composed almost completely of lists.  MOS discourages lists in articles, so these should be turned into prose as much as possible.
 There are a lot of short sections in the article.  For as many of these as possible, please either expand them or combine them with other sections.
 resolved There shouldn't be external links in the body of the article as there are at the end of the Ancestry and history of domestication section.  Instead, these should be turned into references, moved to the external links section, or removed altogether.
 The article needs quite a bit more referencing.  For example, in the Ancestry and history of domestication section, six out of seven paragraphs are completely unreferenced.
 Make sure that all of your web references have publishers and last access dates.  Also, please make sure that you are actually using the publisher, and not the work.  For example, with current ref #41 (The Case for Tail Docking), the publisher should be Council of Docked Breeds, not cdb.org.  
 resolved References that are in English do not need to be marked as such.  References that are in any language other than English do need to be marked.
 resolved Current ref #70 (Wolf at my door) deadlinks.
 resolved The Australian National Kennel Club external link deadlinks
I didn't go through the article line by line, so there are probably things that I missed.  The above are just fairly big issues that jumped out at me on a quick look through the article.  Also, I was recently involved in bringing Horse (another article about an animal with significant human interaction) to GA status...you may want to take a look there to pick up some ideas about layout, referencing, style, etc.  Drop me a note on my talk page if you have any questions, and good luck on your quest for GA.     —Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

9fd7e6b37010c079,"(The following is not a formal request to be unblocked)

Thank you AnthonyBradbury your comments made sense. The issues I raised relate to the ANI thread still remaining open. Both Erpert,  NEEnt, and now you as an administrator have said that the matter is 'closed.' 

Despite me being blocked 5 days ago and despite Erpert closing the thread and stating no further comments, another editor whatamidoing, removed that and continued making false, baseless claims, quoting inaccurate details, that easily be proved. Further, entirely separate matters, to what my block was for, are now being discussed 'after' I was blocked. Without me having an opportunity to present clear contrary evidence based purely on the objective editing history. And have a fair minded neutral and independent administrator to judge both sides. 

These editors knew there was a ANI thread, but did not comment for 2 days until I was blocked. After I was blocked they then and only then, stuck the boot in, without any facts to back up their false claims. They may have waited until I was blocked because these baselss claims would have been proven false immediately, through me providing diffs and objective facts to the contrary. In fact, they only ceased when I asked for a temporary unblock above to respond! They would have kept 'hammering away' with baseless false claims, providing no facts to back them up and all the while, me being unable to provide the facts. 

I have made some very solid edits to numerous articles. I respect Wikipedia. I respect Wikipedia's policies. I accept the reasons for my current block and would appreciate, after such a significant period, ie. 2 full weeks, to start afresh and be provided an assumption of good faith in my editing rather than editors judging me already. I think all editors, after being blocked should be given the benefit of the doubt. Not to have this thrown in their face for ever more. That's not right. 

I know a lot about some topics. Very little about other topics. My reliable sources have good. My editing and additions have been good. Productive in many different articles. I completely reject being 'incompetent' as whatamidoing states, without me being able to respond. Simply because of differing points of view. I understand whatamidoing and Bilby are very experienced editors who have made great contributions to Wikipedia as editors. No-one is disputing that. They obviously gain a great deal of enjoyment from the project too! Does that provide these editors 'unequal' rights over less experienced editors who are also adding value to the project? Where they can make false baseless assumptions? I realise I have had some previous conflict with the same small group of editors in the past. But that says nothing about my edits being productive and of benefit to the project. 

I believe strongly in the principles of assuming good faith amongst editors. I did not think blocks were punitive whereby other editors can 'mock' the person who has been blocked? Nor are blocks an opportunity to make false, entirely baseless assumptions about an editor's competence. Is the ANI thread closed or is it not closed please AnthonyBradbury? I am hesitant to ask this through a formal request unblocking request. So could an administrator tell me if this ANI thread that was abruptly re-opened by whatamidoing, after the block was already applied, and the thread closed?",0,0,0,0,0,0

I will mention though that I've been commenting on this and similar pages for a long time, but to little effect; it also tends to result in insults and abuse, so it gets tiresome and I don't come around here every day. I thank you that you are not abusive.
One thing that is needful to attain NPOV is to avoid stereotypes. You've just created one (above) though I doubt that you did it intentionally, as some other editors regularly do. This is the portrayal of the opposition as judgemental, hellfire and brimstone types. This would be characteristic only of the most extreme fundamentalists (like Fred Phelps). It is not characteristic of the majority of conservative Christians; even a lot of fundamentalists would not agree, and are in opposition to those like Fred Phelps.
There are actually these extreme judgemental fundamentalists on both sides of the issue; only the guys in the white hats trade with the ones in the black hats. Witness the pro-homosexuals who use judgemental epithets (even on these talk pages) like bigot and homophobe. To get the page into NPOV we have to get past the stereotypes and the epithets.
A more typical conservative Christian view, and a more fair characterization, would be to think in terms of an owner's manual. If you drive your car disregarding the manufacturer's intructions; i.e. you abuse the car in various ways and don't perform the maintainence on the schedule that manufacturer gives, your car will suffer from it. It's not politically correct to mention, but it's simple and plain truth that homosexuals have shorter life expectancy; in fact promiscuity of whatever flavor will shorten a person's lifespan. You can develop the rest of this line of thought as well as I can. -And that is just physical health.

 Etymology 

The etymology section was completely wrong. The Hebrew consonant """"Tsade"""" results from the merging of (at least) two proto-Semitic consonants. They are still distinct in Classical Arabic, as """"Ṣad"""" and """"Ḍad"""". It is easy to see that """"chamets"""" corresponds to the Arabic root ḥ-m-ḍ, because the Aramaic version (which appears in the Aramaic parts of the Hagada) is ḥamiʕa (with `Ayin), and almost all Arabic """"Ḍads"""" map to `Ayin in Aramaic. In Hebrew, the root means both """"sour"""" and """"leavened"""" (cf. """"chamuts"""" =sour; """"chomets"""" =vinegar; """"chumtza"""" =acid). In Arabic it is used mostly to denote """"sour"""" or """"acidic"""". In any event, """"chamets"""" is not related to """"hummus"""" or """"Homs"""". """"Hummus"""" is """"chimtza"""" in Modern Hebrew, and in one case, """"chometz"""" in the Bible might be """"hummus"""" rather than vinegar, but the root is historically different, and only accidentally did they assume the same phonetic shape. 79.177.167.209  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Most of the section """"Mass versus weight"""" doesn't belong to an article about an unit of measurement. If it did, it would belong to the article about the pound, and so on.

 Administrator Guidance to Editor, July 11 2010 
Copied from Spartaz User page:
The Irving article has been noticed on the WikiProject New York page; some helpful comments sent back.  Did not receive notice on your G4 decision; we will be asking to move the article back to mainspace shortly.  Thanks for the aid.   
 No. Unless you have addressed the significant issues concerning allegations of misrepresenting sources and the contention that all of the sources are tangential or trivial then this isn't going back into mainspace.  Humbug!

    I wholeheartedly disagree with your stance on the subject, I believe there is ample evidence to prove the company under the supervision of the CEO in question was not only constructive but accurate. Terry Semel has ran a company which has gave money to lobby groups which wish to alter the design of the internet to favor profit over ingenuity. This would effectively change the measure for which code is ranked since it would also be determined by its purchased bandwidth priority over performance.

I know this is quite difficult to accept for you muslims, but, as it is, this guy was (one of several) Muhammad's teacher. This is an irrefutable fact of history. I realise that the idea of Muhammad having a teacher beside Allah is some kind of heresy for you, but, here's the truth: Muhammad had an Assyrian Christian teacher. Muhammad learned a lot from him. I am not misrepresenting any source by pointing out this well known fact amongst theologians. It may be so, that Sargis Bkheera did not teach Muhammad about everything, but Muhammad gleaned a lot from him.

Here's what AINA says:

633 A.D. (5383)
Muhammad declares himself the prophet of God and originates Islam. It is well known that Muhammad's principal teacher was the Assyrian monk Sargis Bkheera. This accounts for the extraordinary doctrinal similarity between some aspects of Islam and the Assyrian Church of the East. For example, according to Assyrian Church doctrine, there is no awareness of passage of time between the moment of death and final judgement; final judgement occurs immediately even though thousands of years may have passed on Earth. Islam holds this same view. It is also noteworthy that the Koran states that in the day of final judgement the angels of Allah will speak to man in Assyrian.http://www.aina.org/aol/peter/timeline.htm''

Where do you think Muhammad got that from? Of course, he got it from his Assyrian Christian teacher. You want this referenced from some academic work? I'm sure that's no problem. Here you go, take your pick:  He was Muhammad's teacher. Stop reverting unless you have some source refuting this claim.

I and I alone provided for mankind the most powerful machine since the dawn of time. I was foolish to think I'd get a meeting with the president or the Nobel peace prize. I guess I had my little finger cocked the wrong political way when I did it. Since this was known the forces that be have turned their evil cannons of jealousy toward me and ignored every rule in the book, played every unfair card in the book known and made as many unfair ones they could get their hands on to destroy me and steal it and gain credit for themselves on it. You have to decide if you are on the side of truth and life that I intended for this technology to bring or allow those lord high felons to destroy me with unfair and unequally applied rules. Are you going to be a part of that? Why do I say this? Because if I don't stand no honest person will forever thereafter. Have Wikipedia editors blocked William R. Buckley for the admitted first attack here and thereafter continual attacks, one short one and he's back at it,... or blocked SteveBaker for vandalism at all as he continues to do now and do as much damage to me he can? No. Or punished those dealing out blocks to me when they knew I did nothing for political bias? Did Wikipedia give me credit for my work and ban the copyright infringer and ultimate dark and threatening talker Freitas and Merkle  from this place NO! 

Wikipedia's rules clearly allow the publishing of lies from longer standing people of note, no mater how nefariously they slam the up and coming and tell lies far and wide and Wikipedia knowingly lets them. This is a media rag, period. Like any other. There are no real rules when they apply differently to one than another. Further, again, if you are being destroyed by unfair rules you have a Boston Tea party. Get it? It's called """"self defense"""" something you clearly do not understand. The only rule is a fair one and I don't see you or any other here trying to keep them fair in any way form of fashion you are just blowing political smoke. If you did we would not be here. I have not once been treated fairly and I don't see you doing it or anyone here that bothers to hang around here. You speak of rules, then block those that wrongly attacked me first before I even had a chance to play fair. Before I stuck my head out of the womb as a newbie around here. Don't walk away when I am being punished wrongly and you know it and above all don't drag my good name through the mud like a pig would do Mr. media guy. If you treat me fairly, you would be the first, from Larry King to Don and Mike to the Chief of police in Prince William County Virginia who had me arrested five times knowing I was innocent saying I was crazy for just talking about a self-replicator, even with my patent in my hand, gold seal and all (and you won't write of that here, not fairly). You want fair rules start making and enforcing them fairly and changing the unfair ones here starting here and now (but you wont). But most of all punish those who start the transgressions, not those fighting to defend themselves from the initial onslaught. And do not tell me you do not have special preferences around here.

I have contacted every lawyer on the list at the patent office and they will not sue a university professor (to answer you that question). Do me a fair article and you will never hear from me again because I am only here to fight a bad bio attack on me, that is all. I don't like Wikipedia because the rules are unfair here,woirse than any other media operation I've known.

I don't know what you mean by jumping to conclusions, but noted nonetheless. To address your example directly, Dominic Deegan was actually printed, published, and released, which gives it a  bit of a foothold in the webcomic world. It has tens of thousands of Google hits, the first several hundred of which are unique and relevant, and several hundred unique sites also link to it. It also gets a couple million views per month according to Alexa.com. The three methods on their own are not always the best for rating the notability of a subject, but when combined, they give a clearer picture

Some articles are marked for deletion soon after creation, and others aren't marked until several months (or years) after their first edit. However, in the end, they will eventually receive the same scrutiny all other articles must undergo- an unencyclopedic article will not be allowed to exist on the premise that other unencyclopedic articles already exist; they will, in all likelihood, be deleted eventually as well.

As for WP:WEB itself: It's a guideline used to help determine the notability of the site. While the majority of sites that do not meet the criteria are deleted, all of those that do meet the criteria are kept. This criteria is an extension of the following policies:

 Wikipedia:Verifiability
 Wikipedia:Neutral point of view
 Wikipedia:No original research

The following guidelines:

 Wikipedia:Cite sources
 Wikipedia:Reliable sources

And the following tests:

 Wikipedia:Search engine test

Basically, if the site has independent material published about it, receives an award, or is distributed through a notable publisher, information about it can be verified and, most importantly, neutral. This avoids original research. This also allows us to cite reliable sources; Wikipedia is not a primary source or publisher of original research/information.

Sources on Medieval Croatia

Early medieval Croatian history fits the concluding line to the old jingle: the more you study the less you know. When I was and undergraduate studying Balkan history I thought I knew quite a bit about Croatia; but as I study more about Croatia, one by one """"facts"""" that I knew before turn out to be dubious, based on questionable sources or no sources at all. Most of the existing literature in western languages on medieval Croatia is extremely poor; and frequently it is marred by nationalistic bias.

Much of the information about medieval Croatian history comes from later (seveneenth- and eigteenth-century) narrative histories. These were written by enthusiastic people but ciontain a mixture of fact and legend; and since many of the documents they based their works on are now lost, it is extremely difficult to judge wheter their information came from reliable source or not.

One of Ladislaus's most significant achievements was the occupation of Hungary's southern neighbour, Croatia. ... The small kngdom, born in the tenth century, streched from the Kapela mountains to the Adriatic sea, its center being Biograd, located on the coast.

...
King Demetrius Zvonimir, who, not being a member of the ruling dynasty, obtained his throne throug election, asked Pope Gregory VII fo a crown in 1075, and, in return, declared his kingdom as a papal fief. After his death, Ladislaus laid claim on his realm by the right of his sister, Zvonimir's widow, and had no difficulty in taking possession of Croatia in 1091. He bestowed the new kingdom, together with royal title, on his nephew, Almos, son of Geza I ...

I further entertained myself reading yet another great discoveries of contemporary Croatian historians (soc.culture.yugoslavia) ....

The exclusive revelation is the result of """"scientific"""" research by Croatian historian Dragutin Pavlicevic, and found its place in history books. The Split newspaper """"Feral Tribune"""" reveals that Pavlicevic authored a chapter entitled """"Croatian Indians"""", included in the second grade history textbook, shedding new light on the history of native Americans and their ties with Croats, """"one of the oldest nations in Europe"""". He affirms that in North Carolina """"a tribe has been living for more than 4 centuries differing in the color of skin, hair and facial features from other tribes"""". According to the same historian this is not surprising because the members of these tribe """"have the noble blood of ancient Croats from Dubrovnik in their veins"""". Mr. Pavlicevic also speaks about the Mateo Indians, named after their ancestor Mateo - a Croat named Mate. """"In his work, Dragutin Pavlicevic stresses that he estimates that presently there are more than 2 million Croatian descendants throughout the United States"""", states the Split newspaper.

The above statements about the essences of Nichiren Buddhism are which sects did what is a partial explanation; it is clear that it was composed respectfully by someone sympathetic to a particular sect, SGI.  SGI has a powerful voice around and world and has historically represented Nichiren Buddhism to important world leaders who sought it's understanding.  There are at least 2 other schools of Nichiren Buddhism: Nichiren Shu and Nichiren ShoShu.  These sects warn of SGI (but do not prohibit) it's practice; many feel that SGI inherently contains certain personality-cult rituals, and too frequently worship President Ikeda (the current leader of SGI) along with Nichiren and Shakyamuni Buddha.  Nichiren himself has said that he was not a Buddha, but an incarnation of Jogyo Bodhisattva.  The path of the Lotus Sutra is the path of the Bodhisattva  one who delays their own enlightenment until all other sentient beings in the universe have been saved from suffering.  Schools like Nichiren Shu do not believe that the priest should not be worshiped, nor the president, only the Dharma, the Wonderful Flower of the Lotus Teaching.  Several western nations have placed SGI on their respective """"Cult watch"""" lists, and in extreme cases family members have written letters to their governments for assistance in getting their relative de-brainwashed.  This is only in extreme cases with several exigent circumstances.

Let's all remember, shall we, that I never said that Greaseman was dead, simply that he was REPORTED DEAD.  There's a big difference, and the fact that it was reported is not in dispute.  I NEVER SAID GREASEMAN WAS DEAD.  Yet Neutralhomer continues to assert that I did.  THAT IS A LIE.  I consider someone lying about me a personal attack, under Wikipedia guidelines.  Is this a """"separate but equal"""" or """"separate and unequal"""" system?

The admin who blocked me wants more than one source that someone said something on the radio.  Let's look at Wikipedia's entry on Cesar Romero's personal life, shall we?  There is NO source cited for his death, nor his homosexuality, yet those are all sensitive topics, are they not?  Why doesn't Neutralhomer report the author of this page for vandalism?

The fact that Neutralhomer claims that dealing with me gave him a migraine on the talk page of the admin who blocked me demonstrates that this is a personally based effort on his part.

To recap: I never lied.  I never vandalized.  That should be enough.

Now let's look at Wikipedia's reckless report of Cesar Romero's death and homosexuality, shall we?  Sensitive matters, no?

Personal life

Romero believed in liberation theology. Romero was very Christian yet still believed in a utopian society whose belief is that Christ's kingdom would be very similar to Marx's envisionment of communism, and held to this belief until his death.[1][2]

Romero always claimed his grandfather on his mother's side was Cuban poet and patriot José Martí, although his mother's parents were legally Carmen and Manuel Mantilla with José Martí as his godfather. There was some speculation that Maria was fathered by Martí who was a boarder in the Mantilla household, but he never claimed Maria as his daughter in his lifetime.

Romero was never married, despite proposing to at least one woman. Romero made regular appearances on the Hollywood social circuit, usually in the company of an attractive actress, and he was almost always described in interviews and articles as a """"confirmed bachelor."""" Romero discussed his homosexuality in a series of interviews with author Boze Hadleigh, with the understanding that they would not be published during his lifetime.

Romero wore a man's tennis bracelet inscribed with his favorite nickname: """"Butch."""" The term was reportedly bestowed on Romero by his one-time dancing partner Joan Crawford, who teased Romero by telling him: """"You're so butch!"""" While Romero's homosexuality was an """"open secret"""" in Hollywood, the movie-going public was unaware of his sexual proclivities and there was never any embarrassing scandal surrounding his male liaisons, which shows the care and finesse with which he conducted his private life for more than 60 years.

Romero was a mainstay of the Hollywood social circuit until his death in 1994. He was interred at Inglewood",0,0,1,0,0,0

I know W. Lloyd-Thomas and Clifford L.B. Hubbard did some of the older research on the corgi breeds (1930s).  W. Lloyd-Thomas mentioned the Teckel connection (he called it """"Tekal"""") and dated the breed's orgin to around 1200 BC in papers he wrote (some of which I've read).  As is typical in writings of that era, his history is flowery and wordy and doesn't give specifics about the research.  He does say that mid-Cardiganshire is """"particularly wealthy in the remains of early Celtic fortifications (source: """"What the Modern Corgi Owes to its Cardigan Ancestors,"""" AKC Gazette, October 1935),"""" and I can only guess that it's from these remains that the corgi has been dated.  Incidently, it might be better to call the early corgi a """"livestock dog"""" rather than a """"herding dog,"""" as it was more of a guard...not unlike the Rottweiler.

Compared to the Fundamental Attribution Error definition that was provided in quotes, the one provided for attribution theory seems more simplistic and easy to follow, though “social perceiver” may have the same problem as “attributor” did like I mentioned above.

Using “their” instead of “his/her” before “personality” may be better as well, followed by “in which the individual is interacting” instead of “he/she is acting”. This would go well with the next section where “individual” and “their” is used in the place of “he/she” and “his/her”.

You are spot on Leladax. Some with a strong FYROM POV around here argue that 'Republic of Macedonia' is the only official name in use and wish to lock it in at Wikipedia.

While true many nations and NGO's have chosen in the interim to use """"Republic of Macedonia""""... all nations in principle agree to honour whatever name FYROM/Greece can hammer out. When it comes to Wikipedia itself all names should be used if NPOV was actually being observed... especially since the dispute is still ongoing.  Many countries around the world still officially use FYROM (including even the US which still uses both names at times (the US Senate resolution last year condemning FYROM actually used the FYROM name).

What I really think is missing from the article is that technically speaking FYROM is currently in breach of at least a few of its original UN brokered terms with Greece. (This incidentally is exactly why I the why the US government passed the resolution last year condemning FYROM for breaking terms,  why the Greek government vetoed FYROM's  recent attempt at NATO membership, , and why it will probably veto EU membership as well.)

Agreement Violation #1: FYROM was supposed to stick to FYROM for external use

FYROM citizens are now trying to be recognized exclusively as """"Republic of Macedonia"""" even though in Article 7 of the original UN brokered agreement (which their own leaders signed) specifically states

""""the Party of the First Part reserves the right to object to any membership referred to above if and to the extent of the Party of the Second Part is to be referred to in such organization or institution differently than in paragraph 2 of the United Nations Security Council resolution 817 (1993). (which is still be FYROM I believe)

Agreement Violation #2:: Refrain from propaganda against Greek cultural heritage and territory

Article 7 and 11 of the UN agreement between Greece and FYROM state:.

""""Each Party shall promptly take effective measures to prohibit hostile activities or propaganda by State-controlled agencies and to discourage acts by private entities likely to incite violence, hatred or hostility against each other.

If either Party believes one or more symbols constituting part of its historic or cultural patrimony is being used by the other Party, it shall bring such alleged use to the attention of the other Party, and the other Party shall take appropriate corrective action or indicate why it does not consider it necessary to do so.

The article should probably include a few real world examples to show the complaints are very real. I myself recently heard someone from FYROM claim Aristotle was actually Slavic on a forum but there are literally thousands of examples of irredentist behavior to be found. (a small subset of some recent examples that seemed relevant, verifiable and seemingly demonstrate the argument beyond the abstract) 

There exists a steady stream of FYROM supporters on the Alexander_the_Great article history page claiming Alexander wasn't Greek.  

Top ranked FYROM websites  almost universally are writing revisionist histories that suggest Alexander was not Greek  (quote taken from the website)
""""Contrary to modern Greek claims, Macedonia was never part of Greece, and the ancient Macedonians were not regarded as ancient Greeks.""""

Current FYROM Prime Minister welcomes Pakistan “Macedonian” Prince Ghazanfar  and uses it as """"proof"""" of their ancient Macedonian roots. That one really made me cringe considering not so long ago everyone was being assured by FYROM leadership...

'""""We are Slavs, who came to the region in the sixth century. We are not descendants of the ancient Macedonians.""""' Kiro Gligorov (FYROM's first President)

'""""We are not related to the northern Greeks who produced leaders like Philip and Alexander the Great. We are a Slav people and our language is closely related to Bulgarian... There is some confusion about the identity of the people of our country""""'. Gyordan Veselinov  (Canadian ambassador to Canada in interview to Ottawa Citizen in 1999)

(incidentally both quotes appear extremely relevant to the article. I tried to add them myself to the article but they were removed without justification. You are welcome to try.)

So I will start with a criticism of the quote from Ollier and Pain, with whom I have more general issues than the """"postorogenic part"""". Phrase by phrase that I disagree with:
 Only much later was it realized that the two processes [deformation and the creation of topography] were mostly not closely related, either in origin or in time. Very wrong. Deformation causes topography, and the generation of topography is synchronous with deformation. I will email you a copy of Dahlen and Suppe (1988), which shows that this is the case - send me a message so I have your address and can attach a PDF. They tackle the large-scale deformation of sedimentary rocks via folding and thrusting during orogenesis.
 ...fold-belt mountainous areas...: """"fold-belt"""" isn't used professionally (AFAIK) to refer to a collisional mountain-building event. A minor thing though.
 Only in the very youngest, late Cenozoic mountains is there any evident causal relation between rock structure and surface landscape. and the following sentence: If I were British, I would call this """"utter twaddle"""". As I mentioned above, there is no way for many of the exposed structures to get to the surface without large amounts of rock uplift and erosion. And as a matter of fact, the trajectory of different units of rock through an orogen is in part determined by patterns of surface erosion. To keep it simple and send you one paper, you'll find this in and at the end of the paper by Dahlen and Suppe (1988).

 Useful Links for Recycled Lumber   Nina

 Diminishing returns from recycling? 

I propose that Steven Landsburg's arguments be either removed or shown to be refuted by the below logic. I personally think that the argument below, no matter how logical, would be too large to include. Similarly, Landsburg's arguments are provably illogical, and should not be included.

""""Economist Steven Landsburg has claimed that paper recycling actually reduces tree populations. He argues that because paper companies have incentives to replenish the forests they own, large demands for paper lead to large forests. Conversely, reduced demand for paper leads to fewer """"farmed"""" forests.[34] Similar arguments were expressed in a 1995 article for The Free Market.[35]""""

If the variable of incentive to plant new trees is taken to be proportionate to the number of trees required for paper, as this scenario suggests, then the only way that the scenario is true is if it not only assumes that the paper companies are planting fewer trees than they cut, but that more trees are cut down than exist. 

The simplest refutation of the scenario is the model where lumber companies plant as many trees as they cut down. In this case, the number of trees not cut down, due to less paper being required, is immaterial, as the lumber companies would simply plant a number equal to what had been cut. In addition, more old trees would stand.

However, let us pursue the other, and in my opinion more likely, scenario. Companies cut down more trees than they plant. For the sake of simplicity, consider this hypothetical starting state. Forestry companies cut down half existing trees, and replant half of the difference between what stood and and what has been felled, or 25%, for a total of 75% of the original number, if not the original quality, the new trees being young growth. Let us say recycled paper amounts to one half of the trees cut, 12.5%, which would bring the total in terms of usable resource to 87.5%. If it were not added, the next cycle would see the 75% cut, literally, in half, for 37.5%; half is replanted, for a total of 56.25%. If it were added, the 87.5% would be halved to 43.75%, and the company replanting half of that would make a total of 65.625%, almost 10% more trees.

It does not matter whether the companies plant as many as were cut, if they are induced by the remaining forest amount, or a percentage, or induced by the paper supply, or a percentage; it always ends up with less forest cut down. If Landsburg is a notable economist, it speaks ill of economists; he has not exhibited logical reasoning or the capacity o",0,0,0,0,0,0

Ok, first off, let me clarify that reverting is when you undo someone else's edit (yes, it does include the re-addition of material that has been removed by another user). Your use of the word """"vandalism"""" is incorrect in this case, because everything that you have been involved in so far is classified as a """"content dispute"""", since you and your opponents have been disputing whether certain text should be included. This is not a case of vandalism (this is, for example). Secondly, many of the users that you have been reverting or the ones that have been reverting you are on the same restrictions, so IMO now everyone is equal, and no one is """"winning"""" or """"losing"""". What I've tried to explain to you is that edit wars get nothing accomplished. You keep reverting and reverting, and then someone reverts you, and the cycle continues. Wikipedia articles aren't meant to go back-and-forth like that. The only real way you get something accomplished is by discussing it with other users, in the hopes that you can form a compromise, or consensus. To answer your numbered questions:
After we last spoke you continued to revert (, , , ). On Sason, you reverted 3 times in the last 24 hours. Even though you came close to breaking the three-revert rule (which you were blocked for on May 31), three reverts is not some sort of magic barrier that prevents you from being blocked. An admin could have easily blocked you for simply edit warring. This is the type of stuff that occurred on Armenian-Azeri pages for example before the arbitration case. After that many users were placed on editing restrictions, a lot of the problems were solved. Aggressive editing can be characterized as constant edit warring, and basically a method of getting your version of the article by constant reverting as opposed to discussion. Is is the exact opposite of what is outlined at WP:1RR. Even if you believe the information you are adding is NPOV, if it is contested by several users, the best thing is to discuss it with them, and once you have come to an agreement, to implement that version. 
I'm sure you've tried to be civil, but here I notice you referring to your opponents as """"vandals"""", this is inappropriate because as I explained above, you're involved in a content dispute here. If other users have personally attacked you, please show me links of this and I will warn them. It is never acceptable to do so.
Yes, it is possible. You can get mentored at Wikipedia:Adopt-a-User. Wiki-adoption was created back in 2006 as a program designed to help new and inexperienced users.
Although you may disagree with him, it is within Namsos' right to nominate an article for deletion if he believes it is non-notable. However, as you can see from the discussion at Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Erich Feigl, it appears that many users there are deciding to keep the article, so I'm not sure that it matters anyways. Everything that you mention (awards, documentaries, books, Google hits, etc.) can be mentioned at the AfD (articles for deletion page). I have noticed that you've already made a comment there already. Make sure to keep an eye on that page, the discussion is typically open for five days.
I don't know the specifics about why your sources were removed, but if you feel like you're not getting anywhere with these disputes, you might try posting something at the Reliable Sources noticeboard if there is a dispute on whether your sources are valid or not. Another option is the new Ethnic and cultural conflicts noticeboard. Finally, after you have made all attempts at resolving the conflict (including those two links I gave you), and you still feel like nothing has been accomplished, you can check out formal mediation. There, a mediator will get involved and act as a third party.
I hope all that I have said is helpful. Please feel free to drop a note on my talk page if you have any further questions/comments. khoi """,0,0,0,0,0,0

My mistake. The reason for the dispute should be obvious. The sentence that I removed is indicative of the overall tone of the rest of the article: """"It is best to stay clear of this game and those running it."""" Wikipedia does not give gambling advice to begin with, but the tone issue is much deeper set. A few more examples:
""""the operators...can be dangerous if provoked.""""
""""the man perpetrating the swindle""""
""""if played fairly, which it never is""""
""""players (victims)"""" multiple instances of this
""""nearly all the persons standing around the game work for the operator""""
""""Shills are normally rather easy to spot: they win.""""
""""Amazingly, today, the shell game swindle is still performed on the unwary in larger cities.""""

The whole text needs surgery, not just these examples. Original research means that these alleged facts are not cited to any source, nor could many of them be. What source would you cite, for example, to prove that the game is never played fairly? This article needs to be cleaned up to only state the facts about the shell game, as they can be cited to reliable sources, and in a manner which does not take sides between those who play the game and its proprietors.

 2011 British GP team orders 

Before this turns into an edit conflict, what needs to be considered is that stating 'Vettel finished second after ...team orders...' incorrectly implies that he finished second because of those team orders. Since Webber himself admits that he ignored the team orders and still tried to overtake Vettel, IF it needs to be included, it needs to be reworded:
Although Vettel's KERS was malfunctioning at times, he was able to pass Massa on the track and took back second place. After a strong charge from Mark Webber towards the end, Webber was asked to """"maintain the gap"""" and not try to make a move on Vettel. Although Webber ignored his team's requests and tried to pass Vettel, Vettel was able to hold him off and finish second behind Alonso.http://www.perthnow.com.au/sport/grand-prix-2011/frustrated-mark-webber-ignored-team-orders-in-vettel-chase/story-fn7r7gmb-1226092001816""",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Correct me if I am wrong 
It says kennedy cost him 2 title shots
but didnt Batista cost the undertaker his title shot on the second one?

Yes and no, Kennedy attacked Batista, which led to Batista attacking Kennedy, thus in a manner, that was Kennedy costing Undertaker his second attempt at a title shot. ( )

Can sum1 add a trivia to undertaker saying that his world champonship win is his first title in 5 years upon winning the WWE championship in 2002

 Kane The Undertaker? 

Why is that under his nicknames in his stat box?

Because for a few weeks after he came to the WWF he was called Kane the Undertaker on WWF TV by Mooney and Okerland. That was the real name but it just got cut down to The Undertaker by the time Royal Rumble came arround.( )

Yea, I don't really get why the whole Kane thing is added either. I mean, it was something that wasn't aired and no one even knows about. The company doesn't even care about it as they never put it anywhere.  

He was announced at his TV debut as """"Kane, the Undertaker"""", as was just stated above, Twentyboy. And WWE doesn't talk about Katie Vick, so why should we talk about that, by your logic. - Hamlin 

His debut and first match (I think on Superstars) both listed him as """"Kane the Undertaker"""".

If you had any knowledge then you would read the article and u would see his debut and first match was at Survivor Series —The preceding unsigned comment was added by  (talk • contribs) .

Hr debuted as Cain The Undertaker and became the Undertaker after that. 

 Championships 

Undertaker did not win the WCW Tag Team Championships in WCW. He won them with Kane, while in WWE, during the Invasion angle, before the titles were unified. Stop adding it to a seperate section for a promotion his championship partner never wrestled for. - 

 Tag the Criticisums section 

I'v noticed that the Criticism section is quite biased toward The Undertaker. I don't knoow how to tag it for haveing disputed neutrality so can someone do that for me?-Terminator Storm

 undertaker/badass 
I think the half Undertaker/half Badass gimmick is ruining the Undertaker, not to mention the lack of appearances. Because he's sort of doing both, I don't think fans know whether to be scared or act like their at a roll'n roll'n concert. I liked him as the Undertaker, but that was back when I thought he was scary in the 90s. I don't have a problem with his badass side, btu I think he should stick to one or another because it's just confusing to me. Oh well, he's probably rich as it gets the way the company praises them like he's God so I suppose it doesn't really matter to him. I just have a problem getting the whole 90s Undertaker vibe when he pulls off his top and raises his arm, then pulls it back on and falls to one knee worshipping the urn and Paul bearer that aren't there. That's another thing, Paul Bearer with all the faces throughout the entrace, pulling off of the coat, using the power of the urn was a big part of that whole character. I think he should just give up on being the Undertaker because he isnt' scarying anyone anymore. That character was a good one that was meant to be scary, not changed into all sorts of rockers. I know you wrestling fans who are crazy about him are going to have a tizzy over my remarks. I'll just ignore them.  

This page is not for talking about the person/character, it is to discuss what should be done to the article. Also, ignoring critics is not the Wiki atitude. TL

 RfC: (Policy) Using bad practices from one article to justify another and possible sock puppetry; and (Politics) Acceptability of aggregated data in """"Election Results"""" section 

Policy
While not getting into the issue of reverting edits without first reaching out to the original editor to understand their motivation (in this case, the deletion of a table),  justifies the reversion of my deletion by pointing to other articles with the same flawed table...which he created!

Examples:

https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Papineau_%28electoral_district%29&diff;=prev&oldid;=654041277 - the above article
https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ottawa_South&diff;=prev&oldid;=593333525 - Ottawa South
https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Edmonton_Strathcona&diff;=636097681&oldid;=622403799 - Edmonton Strathcona

While we're on this topic, I found an identical table with identical formatting and citation in Toronto Centre...but added by !

https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Toronto_Centre&oldid;=670004225

This strikes me as possible sock puppetry.  I'm hoping a more sophisticated WP editor can either confirm or deny my hypothesis.

Earl Andrew already admitted to working as a polling firm employee in Ottawa. It seems likely the same user is responsible not only for adding the content cited, but actually generating it in meatspace.  This in itself wouldn't make the content non-NPOV, though one has to wonder why Earl Andrew guards Canadian electoral district pages so jealously (including the """"Political Geography"""" sections which he invented, the topic of our last edit war).  Articles about Canadian electoral districts are not Earl Andrew's soapbox and should not be treated as such.

Further, in the edit history of every single article mentioned above (only a handful, but statistically, that makes the following more damning), Earl Andrew and Fungus Guy are responsible for the lion's share of edits. While I understand that topics as specialized as Canadian politics may have only a handful of active editors, this appears to be a suspicious pattern and should be treated with all due seriousness.

Politics
's """"Redistributed results"""" tables and the identical table added by , are composed of data aggregated from Elections Canada results.  I take no issue with the data, but being aggregated, they are no longer results.  As such, they should at least be moved into a more relevant section with an explanation, if not removed altogether.  Putting the table in the """"Election results"""" section implies they are Elections Canada tallies, quite possibly having the effect of misinforming voters.  And we're right in the middle of an election campaign!

Unsorted
I could have done a lot more editing in the past 4+ years, but instead shied away from larger and more time-consuming edits and rewrites because I felt the end result might be another """"100,000 Edit Man"""" coming out of the woodwork to stifle me.  When more voluminous editors are allowed to browbeat others into submission because they generate a lot of """"content"""" or have a page full of barnstars, it necessarily degrades the quality of WP by reducing the number of editors.  It's hard enough to fight the paid corporate trolls on here, dammit!

It depends whether we want Wikipedia to be cutting-edge. It is clear to anyone studying Time Cube that Dr Ray's discovery of the Ineffable 4-Corner Truth renders him worthy of the positions of Greatest Thinker and Wisest Human; he is thus granted the authority to bestow a doctorate upon himself. The only reason not to recognise this doctorate is compliance with the general stupidity that has precluded rapid acceptance of Time Cube.

Well, I myself am not so keen on dumbing down Wikipedia for the stupid and closed-minded people; although some people do seem to be, as evidenced by the censorship of the following material:

In late 2004, and in the midst of a prolific period of Time Cube evaluation marked by his creation of new and inspirational Cubic scriptures, Dr Ray took the Cubic disproof of religious concepts to the next level, by solving the major philosophical question: """"Why something rather than nothing?"""" The answer, as published by him on his Time Cube website, related to the principle of opposites (in this case, static rather than dynamic/cyclical opposites), an important element of Cubic geometry: """"Between the opposites, all things are created. As an entity, they exist only as a big zero, seen from space as something and nothing from every possible view.""""

It appears that the religious zealots want there to be a lack of solution for """"Why something rather than nothing?"""", so that they can use it as a proselytisation/brainwashing tactic. Thus, when the solution is revealed, they cover it up as part of their efforts to prevent awareness of the Cubic Truth, which, as we know, disproves God and exposes religion as an evil Word-scam. 

It seems a pity, but in reality, great things don't come easy. We must all fight to break the Word-shackles of religious and Academic-induced 1-corner ignorance, and force teachers to teach Cubicism above evil cubelessness. Humanity's sole hope of salvation lies with 4-corner Cubic knowledge.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

28f2b6c3207698b9,"That statement is the only thing I cannot believable about the Pirate Bay trial.  I hope they win the trial but there is no way they operate at a loss.  My friend operates a website that draws 500000 people per month on average.  With the same or less ad coverage as pirate bay, he earns 1 US dollar for every thousand visitors.  For pirate bay, this equates to 1 thousand dollars for every visitor they have.  They claim 25 million active members, so figure a lower number of 5-10 million per day.  This brings in as high as $10000 per day if I'm staying conservative.  This is not counting donations and likely better ad deals due to the large numbers of people being drawn and time of each person spent on the website (ie, multiple hits by a person per day).  So the amount of money being drawn in per day has a lower limit of 10 grand.  365 days in a year, unless these people are complete morons they should be bringing in at least a million per year gross income.  More likely several million.  With these numbers, if they only get a million hits per day, which is well within everyone's, including piratebay's, estimations, then they would still be making on the order of $365000 per year.  There is no way operational costs equal or exceed this value even if they bought brand new servers every other year, which doesn't seem logical given my knowledge of networking.
Now they might be incorporating expansion costs, ie the new server banks in Russia and other countries, and other related costs to expansion in costs of business when saying they operate at a loss.  Hate to break it to ya, this means they're just spending money they already earned.  So yes, they do in fact earn that much money, they just spend it as fast as they earn it.

Removing some wiki links from """"External Links"""" section (These links are irrelevant to post-disco): a Hi-NRG link and Italo Disco link. In fact, Post-disco influenced italo-disco in beginnings, but italo-disco is other class music. Taking it all, Italo-disco link you can find in infobox, in """"Derivative forms"""" segment.   

 Dance-rock redirection 

I change the dance-rock redirection, from dance music to  [[Post-disco#Dance-Rock]] . From actual-point-of-view , Dance-Rock can not have its own article, because of its sources. Dance-Rock's only source is All Music Guide, so there can be a WP:V problem. Anyway, Google finds """"nothing"""" (only just irrelevant pages), except.. yes AMG and Last.fm. However, some remarking have page of Billboard magazine from 2004.

I also created Dance-Rock redirect.   

AllMusic source
This article is one of a number of music genre articles that were created solely using AllMusic as a source, and for which few other sources seemed to be available. I'd rather have just deleted it, but decided instead to trim and rephrase it so that it was perfectly clear that elevating the term """"post-disco"""" to genre status was apparently an attempt to fill a gap in AllMusic's taxonomy of genres, and that it was the creation of a now-uncredited individual author who was paid to write it. Also I wanted to show the author never really defined it as a musical style; it wasn't ever established how it was related to disco on one end and house music on the other.

Recently the article has been expanded to cite other mentions of """"post-disco"""". I'm fine with that, but I'm not convinced every use of the term was really intended to be interpreted as a genre name. I'm just afraid this article is doing the exact same thing the AllMusic blurb did: trying too hard to give traction to a name for something that really didn't have a name, or that perhaps was only called """"boogie"""". I feel like I'd rather see a section of the Boogie article devoted to the dance music genre than to continue down the road of searching for vague references to dance music in the post-disco era as evidence of an accepted genre name. —  
My opinion is that post-disco is also genre (""""boogie""""), but also a movement, but that's WP:POV. I don't know.. I mean I don't understand what's really """"post-disco"""" (after disco era / boogie genre ?) means at all. If it is """"era"""" so all tracks to present is """"post-disco"""", but if it is a genre... (unsourced; only AMG and some kind of sites like """" danceclassics.net"""" etc).   

 OR & source misrepresentation in lead: analysis 

None of the cited sources other than Allmusic suggest that """"post-disco"""" is a genre. Many of the citations are also WP:SPS.

The term post-disco (or simply boogie) has multiple meanings. Citation does not support the assertion that """"post-disco"""" has multiple meanings or that it is a term interchangeable with Boogie

Sometime after 1990,AMG was founded in 1991 —  an Allmusic editorial contributor used """"post-disco"""" in an attempt to isolate a dance music genre in the era between the indistinct """"end"""" of disco music and the equally indistinct emergence of house music. Proposition unsupported by a third party verifiable source, this is editorial analysis therefore WP:OR

Text moved from article

 has been making extensive changes to the article.  Some of them changed clear and precise to less clear and precise language (such as """"implies that"""" to """"leads to the view that""""), some changed one stylistic approach to another, and some turned U.K. in to U.S. English, but the main section is this:

""""The second horn of the dilemma (known as divine command theory) runs into five main problems. First, it implies that the moral status of things is wildly contingent—if he had wanted to, God could have made rape, murder, and torture morally right. Secondly, it threatens the  normative force of the claim that God is good—it turns into the mere claim that God is consistent, or that God approves of himself. Thirdly, it commits the naturalistic fallacy; to analyze evaluative claims (e.g., that murder is wrong) in terms of what God has or hasn't said is to reduce evaluative claims to mere descriptions of God's activity. Fourthly, it seems to make morality subjective, with moral truths determined by the mere attitudes of an individual. Fifthly, it threatens the conception of God as a  rational being. For, supposing God had a reason for forbidding rape, this reason should also be the reason that rape is wrong. Otherwise, God's decision would have been based on the wrong reason. But if the reason rape is wrong is that God has forbidden it, then it can't be God's reason for forbidding it, on pains of circularity. So God's moral decisions were based either on the wrong reason, or on no reason at all.""""

Some of this can usefully added, but some isn't really acceptable: """"is wildly contingent"""" is not only unencyclopædic style, but is less clear than """"is arbitrary, based merely upon god's whim"""".  It also introduces technical terms where they're not needed (as does """"normative force"""" which, in addition, surely misses the target; it's not the normativity of """"god is good"""" that's at issue, but its status as a meaningful evaluation).  His or her fourth point isn't very commonly raised, and is surely implicit in the other points.  The final point contains material that could be made use of, but is in fact a discussion of the article's first point.   (Μελ Ετητης) """,0,0,0,0,0,0

The simple answer is...
Mostly Southern (call it 80/20), but with some Midwestern traits. 
For example, Kentucky's hilly topography with many streams and rivers are typical of the South, but the """"United We Stand Divided We Fall"""" motto is totally opposite of most """"State's rights"""" mottos in the South.

I couldn't resist the opportunity to indulge a little. ) Here's the dilly (or part of it) on dopamine, melanin and Parkinson's. Dopamine and melanin have very similar structures, and dopamine metabolism produces a form of melanin called """"neuromelanin,"""" which is different from eumelanin, pheomelanin, et cetera, but still certainly a melanin. Neuromelanin gradually accumulates in the neurons of the substantia nigra throughout a person's life. Kids have very little, elderly people have lots. When people get Parkinson's they start losing their neuromelanin, and their SN goes pale. The fairly recently-published histology and pathology books I'm using just take it for granted that the loss of neuromelanin is basically a side-effect of dopamine depletion. But I may have been a little too confident in assuming that that's the final word. I just checked the National Library of Medicine website and a bunch of new research is turning up more immediate connections between neuromelanin and Parkinson's than had been suspected. Also, it looks like they're also getting promising results in studies on therapies that involve endocrine manipulation of neuromelanin. Still, all of this specifically involves neuromelanin in the dopaminergic neurons of the SN, and I haven't personally learned, heard or run across anything stating that there is any connection whatsoever between skin melanin and Parkinson's. But I guess the take home message for me is that there is more going on here than I realized, so I can't write off the possibility that there is alsothough I can't imagine howsome emerging connection between neuromelanin/Parkinson's and a person's skin melanin levels. Anyway, as you say, this article is about melanin generally, not just skin melanin in humans, so regardless the Parkinson's link is legit.  19:57, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)

Than in the protest section, rather than reporting the events objectively, quotes are used, not from people, but from pro-reformist articles, the result: """"Protesters in Tehran gathered  """"From Imam Hussain Square to Freedom Square"""", """"from east to west along Revolution Street"""", and it was on this day that """"the political and religious symbology of Iran's Islamic regime was turned on its head"""".[10] The protesters made another symbolic move- a """"symbolic journey from a square named after its most revered hero toward a monument dedicated to freedom, along a street called Revolution.""""[10]"""" is unbelievably POV, this should be immedietly changed to a proper written text which reports everything objectively. Meanwhile in the part about the demonstrations condemning the Ashura riots (which BTW, where much larger than the Ashura riots themselfes - a fact which was completely ignored by the writers of this wiki article), """"On December 30, counter-rallies staged and organized by the government at various cities, including Tehran, Qom, Arak, Shiraz and Isfahan called for the death of the protesters, with government workers receiving the day off work in order to attend the demonstrations"""" the sentence """"with government workers recieving the day off work in order to attend the demonstrations, was added in such POV manner and clearly to discredit those demonstrations.

Now although it is mentioned how rioters set fire cars, shops, banks and power stations (though other vandalism by the rioter isn't mentioned at all), this is such small part of the article. The violence by rioters (against people) is not mentioned at all, meanwhile there is a complete section devoted to alleged government violence against the protestors. The article is also clearly written with a goal of reporting only what is good for the green movement, this is illustrated not only by the POV quotes but by for isntance the way that whenever government claims are reported, they are immedietly rebuffed with other POV claims, leading me to believe they were only included to """"expose"""" the government as liars (which is POV). An example is """"Although official sources in Iran denied involvement of security forces in killing of protesters, at least one amateur video shows, the security truck which was deliberately running over the protesters.[16] Other evidence says that security forces were armed with guns and shot at protesters, including one amateur video showing a plainclothes security force directly shooting at protesters.[17],"""" with source 16 being non-existant and source 17 being a vehimently anti-Iranian blog showing a video of a gunman, of which there is no proof he is associated with the police of basij.

 Section needs to be edited 

This line about New Hampshire is not very accurate:

On January 17, 2000, for the first time, Martin Luther King Day was officially observed in all 50 states.[4] Prior to that New Hampshire and Arizona did not observe the day.

In fact, New Hampshire passed """"Civil Rights Day"""" in 1991, to honor Dr King, and other civil rights activists like Rosa Parks and Malcolm X.  Since the article states clearly that other states, such as Utah, have different names for the holiday, including combining it with Confederate military heroes, this sentence does not seem justifiable.  The article leaves the impression that New Hampshire was some sort of bigoted state, that was one of the last to recognize this holiday.

I assure I have no axe to grind on this subject. There may be ideas put forward through certain forms of creationism that I simply do not believe because it contradicts the available scientific evidence and I may find certain claims put forward as science exaggerated. It would not stop me reporting those beliefs if they represented a significant number of people or if they had a significant impact in a given society even though they were only held by a minority, albeit influential, section of the community. For example if a country has only small minority of people who believe in a literal six days account of creation yet they have an disproportionate influence on that society, for example in education, politics or the media, then I would cite the best available work(s) I know that support their idea but I would also put in the best arguments against them in a concise summary of the issue with links wherever possible to other articles that examine particular issues in more depth. I approach these kind of articles by imagining that I am an open minded reader who knows little about the subject but would like to see what the main issues are without anybody censoring or filtering out material they personally do not believe in. This imaginary reader likes to form his own opinions based on the best available information with a preference for top down structure in the article, i.e. general outlines of the issue followed by a more detailed exposition.

In fact, one of the most egregious ways in which tags are being abused is that they're being used for POV-pushing and opinion mongering.  Wikipedia doesn't allow personal opinions in the bodies of articles, and has numerous safeguards in place to prevent it, but having your personal opinion about the nature of an article in the format of a tag, and that opinion will be allowed to disfigure the article practically forever.Were I of a mind to fight against an article I disagree with, politically or philosophically, I wouldn't try to change the text or duke it out on the talk page, I'd stick a """"neutrality disputed"""" tag on it and walk away.  The tag would sit there on the top of the page, big as life, scaring people away from the article, even though I provided no evidence to back it up, and did not have to go through any process before I posted it.  In fact, by simply starting an argument on the talk page, I can provide the backing someone disputing the tag might need  and I get the argument out there without it having to prevail  simply the existence of the argument justifies the tag.I'm not at all saying that's what's going on here  as I said I'm not concerned with this specificity of this tag  but it's another example of why tags are dangerous and should not be accorded the kind of carte blanche they curently receive.

Dear Samir,

My name is Jonathan Obar user:Jaobar, I'm a professor in the College of Communication Arts and Sciences at Michigan State University and a Teaching Fellow with the Wikimedia Foundation's Education Program. This semester I've been running a little experiment at MSU, a class where we teach students about becoming Wikipedia administrators. Not a lot is known about your community,  and our students (who are fascinated by wiki-culture by the way!) want to learn how you do what you do, and why you do it. A while back I proposed this idea (the class) to the community HERE, where it was met mainly with positive feedback. Anyhow, I'd like my students to speak with a few administrators to get a sense of admin experiences, training, motivations, likes, dislikes, etc. We were wondering if you'd be interested in speaking with one of our students.

So a few things about the interviews:
 Interviews will last between 15 and 30 minutes.
 Interviews can be conducted over skype (preferred), IRC or email. (You choose the form of communication based upon your comfort level, time, etc.)
 All interviews will be completely anonymous, meaning that you (real name and/or pseudonym) will never be identified in any of our materials, unless you give the interviewer permission to do so.
 All interviews will be completely voluntary. You are under no obligation to say yes to an interview, and can say no and stop or leave the interview at any time.
 The entire interview process is being overseen by MSU's institutional review board (ethics review). This means that all questions have been approved by the university and all students have been trained how to conduct interviews ethically and properly.

Bottom line is that we really need your help, and would really appreciate the opportunity to speak with you. If interested, please send me an email at obar@msu.edu (to maintain anonymity) and I will add your name to my offline contact list. If you feel comfortable doing so, you can post your name  instead.

If you have questions or concerns at any time, feel free to email me at obar@msu.edu. I will be more than happy to speak with you.

Thanks in advance for your help. We have a lot to learn from you.

Anyway, there is an issue that I have, that has to do with Wikipedia. A user on here had been stalking me and asking some innapprpriate questions. Do you have any ideas of what I could do. I know that user is also from Australia. Could the police here do any thing?

 Are you kidding me? What does this guy have to do to have somebody shoot across his bow, once?  Murder somebody? GabeMC is out of control!! This editor has insulted many editors repeatedly. He mispells user names repeatedly, to intimidate, accuses all opposers, of his idea, as socks, calls them trolls, charges them with harrassment and is generally abusive. He incites other users to drum up charges against """"his enemies"""" of this issue. He has been warned before for changing """"The"""" to """"the"""" in musical articles while his own launched medcom mediation is in progress, ebfore, and yet when his misbehaviour is pointed out in ANI he creates such a ruckess with sidetrack issues he gets away with more disruption and a blessing. He has had editors topic banned, adminstrators banned for a six month period and investigations into every editor that has ever disagreed with on this topic. He has disrupted many Beatles talk pages with his """"Straw Polls"""" simultaneously for the same the/The issue when he doesn't get the right support.

During mating the male bites the female on the back of the neck, and it is noticeable that many cats will adopt a 'ready' posture, when not in heat or even male cats, when grasped by the scruff. 62.49.6.17  
I've added this, see Cat#Skin Think outside the box 

 Scientific classification 

It appears that the current use of F. silvestris catus as the main scientific name is the result of a somewhat misguided interpretation of developments in taxonomy. I propose it is changed back to F. catus. First, this is a continuation of a lot of past discussion; most recently:
/Archive 8#Species name, and
/Archive 8#Scientific name
This discussion seems to have petered out into inactivity. It was noted that publications had started using silvestris catus, but no such citations were given. The article in its current state (under #Scientific classification) cites ICZN opinion 2027. However, as was noted in the prior discussion, this is a misinterpretation of the ruling, which was specifically aimed at wild animals and did not affect domestic animals; see this note, specifically reading from """"This erroneous nomenclature"""" and the preceding paragraphs. ITIS was also cited in discussion. This clearly prefers catus as the conventional name, although it cites MWS in noting that silvestris is also a synonym.

It would therefore be much more NPOV to acknowledge F. catus as the usual name. If catus and silvestris are indeed the same species then this should be discussed under #Scientific classification. Currently, this section should have {{disputed-section|Scientific classification}} put on it, because its interpretation of the source is wrong. I would do this, but I'm a new user, so semi-protection is stopping me. It would be even better if somebody can provide a source explaining the equivalence; all the most cited, most reliable sources in this discussion so far have favoured F. catus.

Also, while this is still semi-protected, I'd like to point out that both inline citations of Mammal Species of the World should be removed. The first is uncalled for by WP:LEAD#Citations. The name """"cat"""" is common knowledge and is recognised by all 62 other references in the article body. The second deals with specific species names for cat breeds. MSW doesn't even mention these names, so it's unfair to synthesise from that that Wozencraft, let alone all feline biologists, does not support them. However, MSW is a useful reference, so I suggest moving the citation to external links, or a probably-needed """"Further reading"""" section.   
Works for me. My opinion last time was that we should go with whatever the reliable sources say and F. catus is now the accepted name, then so be it. ''''  {chat} 
MSW3 is the canonical listing of mammalian taxonomy. It uses Felis catus and notes there is some controversy. We should do the same. -  (talk) 
I view this with suspicion. If 's interpretation is true, then ITIS should not report the domestic dog as Canis lupus familiaris, and call Canis familiaris invalid. The ITIS webpage has no entry at all for Felis silvestris catus, not even to call it invalid. Felis silvestris catus is used more and more frequently in the scientific literature. I draw this from scholar.google.com: 
From 1982-1991, 0 uses of Felis silvestris catus, many uses of Felis silvestris f catus'' whatever that notation means.

You are right about Science and Creationism going in two different directions - Science starts with the facts and looks for an answer, which in this case is most likely Evolution. Creationism starts with the answer (your reading of the Bible - I say that advisably because most Christian leaders don't agree with your interpretation) and then makes up the facts to suit.

Obviously Green Lantern or Robin are examples of a superhero name taken by several individuals, but the standard seems to be to create a 'main' article about the character name/legacy and give some details about each.  If more detail is needed/warrented, provide a link to the 'main article'.  Obviously this is also affected by the significance of the character.  Starman (comics) for instance gives descriptions of all of the many characters with that name, but only re-links to those individuals who have been notable using that psuedonym.  For Shadowhawk it seems as if the mantle of this character was passed cleanly from one person to another, so I'd say keep it all in one article as with articles such as Phantom Lady or Black Canary.",0,0,0,0,0,0

24dfe972109d27b9,"I think Serven made an error on the patent numbers, then.

The citation you removed is the US Patent Office Database  there's no way to link directly to an individual patent there, which is the reason I cited the database and included information in the footnote about how to see the patent itself. Take a look at #138  it isn't issued to Colt, it has nothing to do with guns, and it was issued in the wrong year. Then take a look at X9430: for a revolver, issued to S. Colt on Feb. 25, 1836. (For both of those, you have to enter the number of the patent you want to see, then click the option to see images  there are no transcriptions, but they have scans of the original documents.)

The link I gave above  X-Patent  discusses the patents that were destroyed. Prior to 1837 (and the fire that destroyed the patent office's copies of those first patents) patents weren't numbered. After the fire, in 1837, the Patent Office started numbering all new patents, beginning at 1. They also started trying to recover extant copies of old patents, and numbering them as they found them, but beginning with X1. So pre-fire (1836 and earlier) patents are X-series, post-fire patents don't have the X. The patent Colt was issued in 1836 was an X-series patent, because it was issued before the fire. Anything without an 'X' can't be the right patent number for that date.

When sources conflict, we need to go with the primary sources above secondary sources. And the actual scans maintained by the Patent Office are about as primary as we can get on this issue.",0,0,0,0,0,0

So by your philosophy would you color it with green because it's a good thing? Wrong. No, consoles do not kill people and yes, it is POSITIVE, but this does not invalidate the fact that it still is something NEGATIVE related to the question. Even the the templates themselves have by default the green color for yes and the red color for no, and that must already  mean something by itself. The purpose of Wikipedia is objectivity, not subjectivity. But what the reader does with the information is entirely up to him. Which means that if he thinks that something positive/colored green is a negative thing for him, that's his problem. He can think whatever he wants of this information. I hope this clears things up."""". To sum it up: Yes=Affirmative=Green / No=Negative=Red, personal preferences don't come into account. Again, as for the Vita issue, this has already been discussed with other editors and there has been reached a consensus in the following page: . If you're not satisfied with the consensus, feel free to discuss away. But next time, please do a little bit more research before you start pointing fingers here. Remember, we're here to help!

According to the 1804 Code Napoléon in vigor at the time of Chopin's birth, Chopin was born a Frenchman - now, whether you want to interpret this as a French national or a French citizen, as far as I am concerned, c'est du pareil au même: he was a Frenchman.
Chopin began travelling outside of Poland - or should we say the Duchy of Warsaw? - in 1828: Berlin; 1829, Vienna, Prague, Dresden; 1830: Dresden, Prague, Vienna; 1831: Vienna, Stuttgart, Paris. In order to travel, he needed a passport and I assume (forgive me Widipedia for assuming) that he travelled on a Polish or Duchy of Warsaw passport.  No, I have no facsimile of it, nor have I ever seen any, but without passport, Chopin could not have left Poland. 
NOTE: In Selected Correspondence of Fryderik Chopin, collected & annotated by Bornislaw Edward Sydow, translated from Polish and other languages Chopin was using in his correspondence, by Arthur Hedley, McGraw-Hill, 1963, p. 90, from what is referred to as Chopin's Album:

I can show you broke the rules of Wikipedia on many instances. Instead of lecturing me, you must apologize for being biased. 

“sweeping generalizations about certain religions?” So you don’t like any criticism about your religion do you? What part of my criticism of Islam was sweeping generalization? I have been very specific so far and tried to provide opposing views to Islam. You simply do not have the tolerance for that. That is why you decry my contributions and call them “sweeping generalization” or try to dismiss them as  Islamophobia. Are views contrary to Christianity Chistianophobia? Do we have anyone crying Judaismphobia, Hinduphobia or Buddhistphobia? Why only Muslims make that claim? It is to silence any voice of opposition. You did that here and you even sided each time with my opponent to ban my views. This is unethical. Is that an insult? Am I allowed to say you acted unethically? Or would I be banned again? If this is not despotism what it is? Of course you can’t jail or kill me. But you do what you can. You censor me, violate my rights and ban me.

 Perpetual Virginity 

The article currently states: """"After giving birth to Christ, Mary did have sexual relations,"""" and """"In the little time that Joseph was still around after the birth of and they had several more children.""""  Certainly some people believe these assertions, but they don't belong in an article that presents the Roman Catholic Church's Marian dogmas.

The article also says that: """"Mary did break her vow by the grace of God.""""  The writer seems to mean that God gave Mary a free pass to have sex but remain a virgin.  That really needs a citation, because I've never heard anything like it.  The RC Church teaches that Mary was really and truly a virgin her whole life, and other people believe she had sex and bore children, but as far as I know, no one teaches that she had sex, but God was okay with it, so we call her a virgin anyway.

There you have it. Noel Malcolm is revered and aknowledged as a neutral and impartial historian. But just because he isn't on of your Serbo-bloggers, you come up with all this shit about his works. When he says """"conquered"""", that is exactly what the term means. Your map is shit. Because Serbs ONLY MADE UP 25% of that land whether it was a bigger or smaller Kosova than today. And I call it KOSOVA because KOSOVA is it's name. It's Serbo-nationalists like you, Dab, and Balkanfever who keep it in it's Milosevic devized name. And you keep going on about the Treaty in London 1913. Well???? What happened???? Certainly nothing to do with Kosova joining Serbia because I said before and I'll say again - if it did, Malcolm would have said it. If he gets things wrong, why is he so well respected by all those reporters in the newspapers listed by Interestedinfairness. Answer that one. Dab, don't confuse the issue. It doesn't matter if Kosova was once it Italy, I tell you that it has never been in Serbia, it only had the bad luck to be in the same """"genocide state"""" as Serbia when a part of Yugoslavia.

 Content Dispute 

I'm going to try and mediate the Iranian peoples dispute here could you please post your arguments there and we'll try and come to an reasonable comprimise   

1)Hi, History section needs clarification, while linguistically all of those people are related but it does not mean that ethnically they are all related to eachother, I am pointing to the last paragraph of the history section. It should be clarified. Thanks. Talk + 
 Modern Persians themselves are a diverse group of peoples descended from various Iranian and indigenous peoples of the Iranian plateau including the Elamites. Although all Persians are linguistically connected to each other ethnic backgrounds are diverse with many different cultural traits. 
Would something like that be preferable to you  

Yes, but the word Iranians instead of Persians. Persians are by themselves a member of that linguistic group. Talk + 
 Ok, I stand corrected (I'm not familiar with the topic matter at hand here, I'm googling trying to find information) - if nobody objects I propse changing the paragraph to the above, it seems clearer to me   

No sorry this paragraph: Thus, not unlike the previous example of Germanic peoples involving the English, who are of mixed Germanic and Celtic origin, Iranian is an ethno-linguistic group and the Iranian peoples display varying degrees of common ancestry and/or cultural traits that denote their respective identities.  Talk + 

Here I meant Iranian peoples linguistically are related but it does not mean that ethnically they are all related to eachother. so the claim refering to common ethnicity in the articler is not correct.
 Talk + 
 Ok, is Germanic peoples involving the English, who are of mixed Germanic and Celtic origin also an ethno-linguistic group? If so, should we add """"only"""" to Iranian is an ethno-linguistic group and the Iranian peoples display varying degrees of common ancestry and/or cultural traits that denote their respective identities
  

The Iranian people Unlike gernmanic people are from quite different etnicities like Turkic, Persian and others uncertain. The whole sentence is wrong and POV. we should drop the word common ethnicity and clarify that it is only a linguistic term'''. Talk + 

2)The info box does not belong here. Iranian peoples are not an ethnic group. They are several different ethnicities speaking different languages. It should be removed as in any other linguistic group. Talk + 
 I think you have a valid point there, I would like to see the argument to the contrary before making a recomendation though.

3)Aryan is a linguistic term that refers to an ancient language group that was ancestral to the Indo-European family of languages''. [http://iml.jou.ufl.edu/projects/Spring01/Millig",0,0,0,0,0,0

I have been accused of sock puppeting, yet they still havnt brought one single piece of tangible proof, even though the other person claimed he was from mexico, which I am from the states. The main reason why I was initially blocked was because of Bigcat82, as his false accusations, bias moderating, lies, misinformation and more lies...7 different people have noted he was bias, and still he is allowed to control the lion vs tiger section with only repeating its not reliable or not a peer journal, none of this is true, for instance, his account where he put on lion vs tiger has been sitting there for going on 6 years and still no one has even peered into it, it is a straight up lie that he said the lion was killed, here is the full article of the 1909 fight:

[url]http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-NuqIbte0hB8/T8DE0k29m2I/AAAAAAAAyuI/uNemgrJ-vfI/s1600/Anotherfightatbostocks.jpg[/url]

Miss informs people, and twists facts, he uses this tactics on the roman accounts, leaving out who won in popmeii and following it in with a non credible source William bridges is not a historian, but he uses it to capitalize on the archaeology book, in fact that book roots to the fact the lion defeated the tiger, as roman/italian sites says the tiger is being attacked by a lion:
[url]http://www.romanoimpero.com/2010/01/pompei.html[/url]

He routes it to the usual that it was a leopard, but the leopard mosaic is in the house of doves, the lion standing over a prostrated tiger is in the house of faun. Several members point out his major flaws such as Bbbeto, as he states its not that the sources arnt reliable he just doesnt want anything that favors the lion and will show the lion as the usual winner, its not that they arent peer jorunals, its that the support the lion, he has erased over 20 things not seeable now on the talk page and edit page, it doesnt matter if its from a trainer, if they support the lion he will call it unreliable and the rules dont apply...what rules? Its only his rules, there hasnt been a consensus done by 10 people at once going on over 6 years? Is this what wiki is for, for who ever is the more persistent and the better liar to be able to control wiki? Its just his ) and he should be banned from editing that topic, since he is already a part of over 20 forums specifically on topic where he has been caught lying, for instance he just said he has graduated from 10 university's...
[url]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:BigCat82[/url]

Really he graduated from 10 of the top university around the world? Show us just one of them, name the university, show us who you studied under, show us a copy of your diploma, he is a pathological liar, look under the bear contributions countless of people call him specifically a tiger fan, look at the talk page there, the lion vs tiger contribution, only he is ever erasing things of favoring the lion, Wikipedia mods should be ashamed for having a person use its search engine for a person pumping out his own propaganda and bias POV for this amount of time unchecked. He now says that no experts favor a lion, really? Define expert, if we look at what wiki has as expert:
[url]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert[/url]

We can see that an expert is someone who has pro-longed experience or observation, the topic is about them fighting, so they have to have excerpts and citations of them seeing a fight...no excerpts of them exist for the tiger so far, yet he disputes people who does, and is considered experts.

 The casual reader should receive the message that the expulsions were agreed to at the Yalta and Potsdam conferences.  They should also be aware that Stalin outmaneuvered the gullible Western Allies at both those conferences.  Stalin didn't care about the Poles (he killed 22,000 Poles, mostly Polish military officers, at Katyn in 1940); Stalin was more concerned about gaining back lands lost in the early 1920s, namely lands within the 1937 Polish border east of the Curzon Line.  That land area had a population which included 40% ethnic Poles.  Stalin needed somewhere to dump those Poles, so he proposed that Germans be moved west & the Poles be moved west.  Roosevelt was dying in 1945 - he was easily outmaneuvered by Stalin.  By the Potsdam Conference in the summer of 1945 Churchill had lost power and had to leave the conference early, and Truman was tied down by Roosevelt's commitments, so Stalin got his way again.   The casual reader should also receive the message that the """"Wild"""" expulsions by both Russian and Polish authorities were begun east of the Oder-Neisse Line and long before the end of July 1945 Potsdam Conference which ONLY authorized the ethnic cleansing of Germans from within the 1937 borders of Poland, and from Czechoslovakia and Hungary.

The reason I say this is that you insist on adding your view to the main body of the article before we've settled it first in the discussion page. Now that's vandalism.

Okay, for many of my thoughts on WikiPolitics, you can read my Request for Adminship. The best feeling is undoubtedly seeing someone read an article you've written, or complimenting it. My advice would be to never forget that, however bogged down in the political posturing you find yourself. Several of our best contributors plug away behinds the scenes day after say, unseen and unheard.
""""Are there any areas that you'd suggest I look into in particular?"""" Nice try, but you're going to have to find that out yourself. You may find that joining a WikiProject can be a useful step, in an area that interests you. (Be warned though, some are more active than others!)
""""What things really annoy you about Wikipedia / which parts do you think could work better?"""" In some ways, the single thing that annoys me most is the assumption that Wikipedia is """"broken"""" and needs to be """"fixed"""". It's never going to be perfect, so we may as well enjoy it now, rather than focussing on some random point in the future when everything will be just right.

I seem to recall RJ saying it was his intention to release the last book as a single book even if needed a new form of book binding to be invented or sold on library carts. If I recall correct, then I can’t help but feel this is NOT at all what he intended to happen.

I can wait for it be bound into a single handcover book. In fact, if that simple intent can’t be honoured, I have to wonder about the story line itself. 

Maybe I can do without “book 12″ entirely.

Louis Says:

Anyone who believes this staggered three volume release is being done for anything other than profit is kidding themselves. If it is not about profits release all three volumes at once, don’t wait for the money that will be generated from three separate hard cover and paperback releases for each volume. This is not about Jordan or his loyal fans. This is about TOR milking it for everything it is worth. This is a slap in the face to every Sci/FI and Fantasy reader that has supported TOR through the years.

Louis Says: 
April 7th, 2009 at 8:19 am 
Releasing this in three volumes is a terrible and sad idea. Readers of the wheel of time series have been waiting 15 plus years to a conclusion to this extraordinary series. Now you are asking them to wait three more yea`rs. This is all being done in the name of profit. Jordan did not want it to go done this way. I am deeply saddened by TOR’S greedy decision.

BOYCOTT ALL TOR AND SANDERSON BOOKS UNTIL SERIES IS COMPLETE!! i’m sorry but if this was really for the fan we’d have heard from TOR books, Harriet and Sanderson on such an OBVIOUS negative response. Consider this Harriet has no control over this book other then an editorial opinion if TOR books decides to replace something they can and will. More then likely there was a large advance granted to mr jordan upon the start of the book and unless the book is finished Harriet more then likely would have had to return that money due tyo the book being unfinished. Sorry folks but medical bills aren’t cheap and when some Corporation has you under contract you have no choice but to at least pretend you have some sort of control. Face it this is a business and the world is in a recession what is the garunteed way to bring in SOME MONEY? Plump up a story and add meaningless splits and’ milk it for everything it is worth, Corporate GREED at its finest again. don’t punish Harriet and not buy the books but BOYCOTT ANY OTHER WORK BY TOR OR SANDERSON UNTIL THE LAST VOLUME IS COMPLETE. WHO KNOWS THEY MIGHT EVEN HAVE IT FINISHED BY NEXT YEAR IF ALL THE FANS BOYCOTT BOOK PURCHASING FROM THEM.

 Bot automation at Wikipedia:Today's articles for improvement 

Over the past two weeks, there has been extensive discussion on introducing bot automation to assist with maintenance of the Today's Articles for Improvement project. A  has now been approved for trial and will carry out the weekly duties. The bots first run will occur around ' (midnight on Sunday).If you have been assisting any of the weekly maintenance tasks, please refrain from doing so this week. The bot needs to be tested and proven it can do the job, and it only gets one chance per week. The tasks will include:
 Adding the new scheduled article to Wikipedia talk:Today's articles for improvement and removing the entry from Wikipedia:Articles for improvement
 Set up the schedule pages for the new TAFI, except the adding of an image and caption
 Adding  to the new article for improvement, remove  from last week's article and add  to the talk page
 Notify relevant WikiProjects that the new TAFI is within their scope
 Send a mass message to everyone on the notification list of the new TAFI selection

Updating the accomplishments and archiving selections is still done manually, along with daily' tasks such as adding approved entries to the articles for improvement page. These will become automated in the near future.

We hope the bot proves to serve well, and by carrying out the routine housekeeping tasks we can boost the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the project.  thanks you for your service in helping with the weekly tasks in the past, and for your cooperation during this trial period )

This has been done because the article seems to be about a person or a group of people, band, or club, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable, that is, why an article about that subject should be included in Wikipedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert notability may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable, and if you can indicate why the subject of this article is notable, you may contest the tagging. To do this, add  on the top of the page (below the existing db tag) and leave a note on the article's talk page explaining your position. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm its subject's notability under the guidelines.

 """"light"""" cigarette 

According to a decision on a lawsuit brought by the USA against Philip Morris, and Philip Morris own documents, the only difference between regular cigarettes and a """"light"""" cigarette is tiny holes placed on the paper that increase the air flow. This increase in air flow increases the mutability of the smoke, i.e. making so-called """"light"""" cigarettes even more likely to cause cancer and tumors than regular cigarettes. Philip Morris has been banned from using the term """"light"""" in the USA.

This is not true. Most light cigarettes are now made by expanding the tobacco, thereby having the same amount of tobacco have more volume, therefore, each cigarette has less tobacco, making them lighter. Not necessarily healthier, but most certainly lighter. But the thing about the paper being the only difference is one of the dumbest things I have ever heard. The filter is more dense for starters. Seriously people, this is supposed to be an encyclopedia, actually what what your talking about before you post.

 Hungary during the Holocaust -The Kastner train 

             The 1955 Kasztner libel case: the verdict of Judge Benjamin Halevi.
The state of Israel claimed that Malkiel Grünwald's allegations against Kasztner were a lie. When Grünwald published these accusations, the Israeli Government did rather more than demand that his views should not be broadcast. Because a prominent Zionist official (Dr. Kastner was a spokesman for the Ministry of Trade and Industry) was involved, the Attorney General of the State of Israel prosecuted Grünwald for criminal libel. Let the verdict of Judge Benjamin Halevi (who later became one of the panel of three judges that tried Eichmann) in Israel's District Court of Jerusalem speak for itself.
The Attorney General v. Malkiel Grünwald
This material should be studied carefully. The masses of Jews from Hungary's ghettos obediently boarded the deportation trains without knowing their fate. They were full of confidence in the false information that they were being transferred to Kenyermeze. The Nazis could not have misled the masses of Jews so conclusively had they not spread their false information through Jewish channels. 
The Jews of the ghettos would not have trusted the Nazi or Hungarian rulers. But they had trust in their Jewish leaders. Eichmann and others used this known fact as part of their calculated plan to mislead the Jews. They were able to deport the Jews to their extermination by the help of Jewish leaders. The false information was spread by the Jewish leaders. The local leaders of the Jews of Kluj and Nodvarod knew that other leaders were spreading such false information and did not protest. Those of the Jews who tried to warn their friends of the truth were persecuted by the Jewish leaders in charge of the local 'rescue work'. The trust of the Jews in the misleading information and their lack of knowledge that their wives, children and themselves were about to be deported to the gas chambers of Auschwitz led the victims to remain quiescent in their ghettos. It seduced them into not resisting or hampering the deportation orders. Dozens of thousands of Jews were guarded in their ghettos by a few dozen police. Yet even vigorous young Jews made no attempt to overpower these few guards and escape to nearby Rumania. No resistance activities to the deportations were organized in these ghettos. And the Jewish leaders did everything in their power to soothe the Jews in the ghettos and to prevent such resistance activities. The same Jews who spread in Kluj and Nodvarod the false rumor of Kenyermeze, or confirmed it, the same public leaders who did not warn their own people against the misleading statements, the same Jewish leaders who did not organize any resistance or any sabotage of deportations . . . these same leaders did not join the people of their community in their ride to Auschwitz, but were all included in the Rescue train. The Nazi organizers of extermination and the perpetrators of extermination permitted Rudolf Kastner and the members of the Jewish Council in Budapest to save themselves, their relatives, and friends. The Nazis did this as a means of making the local Jewish leaders, whom they favoured, dependent on the Nazi regime, dependent on its good will during the time of its fatal deportation schedule. In short, the Nazis succeeded in bringing the Jewish leaders into collaboration with the Nazis at the time of the catastrophe.

The Nazi chiefs knew that the Zionists were a most vital element in Jewry and the most trusted by the Jews. The Nazis drew a lesson from the Warsaw ghetto and other belligerent ghettos. They learned that Jews were able to sell their lives very expensively if honorably guided. Eichmann did not want a second Warsaw. For this reason, the Nazis exerted themselves to mislead and bribe the Jewish leaders. The personality of Rudolph Kastner made him a convenient catspaw for Eichmann and his clique, to draw into collaboration and make their task easier.

The question here is not, as stated by the Attorney General in his summation, whether members of the Jewish Rescue Committee were or were not capable of fulfilling their duty without the patronage of the S.S. chiefs. It is obvious that without such S.S. Nazi patronage the Jewish Rescue Committee could not have existed, and could have acted only as an underground. The question is, as put by the lawyer for the defense, why were the Nazis interested in the existence of the Rescue Committee? Why did the S.S. chiefs make every effort to encourage the existence of the Jewish Rescue Committee? Did the exterminators turn into rescuers?

The same question rises concerning the rescue of prominent Jews by these German killers of Jews. Was the rescue of such Jews a part of the extermination plan of the killers ? The support given by the extermination leaders to Kastner's Rescue Committee proves that indeed there",0,0,0,0,0,0

  Statement on my block 

On 27 June I was asked by Thatcher to help deal with pro-paedo bias historical articles.  

I read your post on WR. I have just dealt with a rampant sockpuppeteer User:Burrburr and friends, whose main activity is to remove such pro-pedo edits from dead historical figures. I suspect he was correct on substance but the abusive sockpuppetry (80+ accounts) was unacceptable. It would be a good thing for a knowledgeable, non-sockpuppet using editor to perform the same sort of review, as long as it is done civilly etc. The pro-pedos will find it much harder to revert someone of relatively higher status (most of Burrburr's accounts edited for only a day or two, so it was easy to label them as vandals or """"single purpose accounts"""" and deprecate their edits). This is, of course, harder to do with an established named editor. Thatcher 

For example, it was being claimed with very little properly sourced evidence that Jules Verne was a paedophile.  I did so with the help of an editor called Phdarts whose contributions I looked at and judged worthwhile.  I made a considerble number of edits to the 

http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&offset;=20080629&limit;=200&target;=Hinnibilis

""""rm politics reference - wrong chapter and is misquoted anyway""""
""""rm absurdly general and unverifiable statement""""
""""rm original research""""

in which I was helped by PhD.  There was no opposition at all from the pro-paedo editors.  

Then I caught this edit to Haiduc's page

""""Like you, I am much pressed for time, though I think that matters have gone beyond personal intervention - however well-authenticated - and now demand third-party intervention (as before). """"

This 'third party intervention' was not long in coming.  Phdart's account has been blocked for sockpuppeteering.  He was, as I suspected, a reincarnation of the banned Headleydown, but I did not have a problem with that.  He was editing under my supervision, and had made many strong contributions to the encyclopedia under other accounts.  (FT2 has pointed to some abusive edits he has made, but haven't we all).

I complained bitterly on FT2's talk page and have also contributed to a thread on paedophilia subjects to the Wikipedia Review.  I did not accuse FT2 of being pro-paedophile, I said that he was 'in effect' enabling the pro-paedophile lobby on Wikipedia.  I do not see how editors with expert knowledge of this subject area can possibly continue to work under these conditions.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

A reply to the argument that Benazir Bhutto mispoke

Benazir was a highly intelligent, highly educated and ex-prime minister.  She is not George Bush.  She does not mispeak.  This is the biggest thing since watergate.  The proof that this is a cover up is shown by the following facts:

i) the experienced reporter David Frost who was interviewing Benazir when she """"slipped out"""" the fact that Bin Laden was murdered did not follow up on it.  In fact he looked palpably irritated and wondering quite how to paper over the issue.  He is in on the game, clearly.  If he was not in on the game then he would have pinned her down on this sensational bit of news.  

ii) Benazir was murdered in a wet job (this is a technical term) about a month after she mentioned that Omar Sheikh (note the triangle of first letters in history) was involved in Bin Laden's assasination.

iii) Nobody in the world's media picked up on a story that Bin Laden was murdered.

So blanket world media silence on the possibility of Bin Laden being dead.  I kinda have a source inside who confirms this.  Acutally it was years ago and not Omar Sheikh, but letters in names can sometimes be telling three times.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

3d968ec4d3c739bf,"Anarchism versus Religion 

Anarchism what does it mean for this anarchist hobbyist?

Anarchism started the First World War over the anarchist assassination of the Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria.  A anarchist decided to interrupt a world power practicing imperialism and assassinated the Archduke as he drove by the anarchist in the tiny nation of Serbia.  What the anarchist did not know is that there were a multitude of secret treaties among no less that fourteen nations including attitude from the Ottoman Empire and within weeks the world was at war as Serbia was invaded.

The result of the war that started in the tiny nation of Serbia is millions of deaths, chemical warfare, proof of machine gun and artillery fire, introduction of aviation into warfare, the Russian communist revolution, and a new world order that led to World War Two, since the Germans believed it was their leaders who failed them causing them to lose the war.

World War Two led to millions of deaths and a larger battlefield across the world including China and the Pacific Ocean (Japan was part of World War One, but the results were insignificant compared to the bloody battlefields of Europe).  The results of World War Two led to nuclear weapons, a space race, spy satellites, nuclear ships, nuclear bombers, nuclear missiles, communism across the world from communist Russia, United States being called imperialist due to being a world wide undefeated military power who is unafraid to invade anyone except the nations with the largest and best militaries (Iraq had a lager but sad capability military).  World War Two also led to the Cold War, Korean War, Vietnam War, and Desert Storm One that was the result of the former allies of World War Two dividing among themselves into two parties and fighting low intensity and hot wars across the world until the year 1991 including, for many families, three or more generations of military service from the United States.

Serbia as a result of the wars across the world of the 20th century has been subjected to the Muslims, Russians, United States, Germans, and civil war within itself and still has United States intervention this 21st century.  Under President Clinton Serbia was made smaller requiring a split of Kosovo and Serbia after a long bombing campaign that exhausted the stockpile of conventional United States missiles during the 1990s.

Serbia got its anarchy and is a backwards nation that has been under subjugation and gunfire since the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand.

Embrace anarchy and declare Heaven non-religion in a discussion section where Heaven is something of the Christian, Jewish, and Muslim faith where the other faiths are atheistic in nature and worship man by a code of conduct, then you should embrace anarchy and go live off the lands in a mountain.  You have little knowledge of mythology and I bet you have no idea what you are doing concerning religion other than your personal attitude.",0,0,0,0,0,0

Robert Deegan 
General Liability Claims Section
Los Angeles Unified School District
333 S Beaudry Ave  28th Floor 
Los Angeles CA 90017  

Dear Mr. Deegan:

This letter shall constitute a claim pursuant to the California Tort Claims Act, Section 910 et seq of the California Government Code.

My address information in compliance with Section 910(a) and (b) is set forth above.

Per Section 910(c), (d) and (e), the date of occurrence was October 5, 2007.  I was assaulted and battered by students T and I and possibly other students at Markham Middle School, 145 W 108th Street, Los Angeles.  The Police Report is DR#071828895.

LAUSD personnel, specifically, Steven Thomas Rooney, aided and abetted violations of the Ralph and Bane Civil Rights Acts, Sections 51.7, 52 and 52.1 of the California Civil Code and Sections 242, 245, and 422.6 of the California Penal Code, by failing and refusing to report the matter to police authorities.  LAUSD violated my rights under Article I, Section One of the California Constitution to safety and my specific right to safety on a school campus under Article I, Section 28 of the California Constitution.  I have suffered physical damages and extreme emotional trauma as a result.

David Brewer and other personnel knew or should have known based upon my complaints and upon past known misconduct by Rooney that Rooney was unfit as a supervisory employee of LAUSD.  LAUSD therefore negligently hired, trained, assigned, supervised and retained Rooney and ignored my complaints about his misconduct.

LAUSD’s conduct towards me is motivated by benign neglect of complaints of discrimination, retaliation, and harassment by Latino employees, as exemplified in past incidents by Superintendent Brewer and the General Counsel’s office failing to properly investigate and take appropriate action when complaints were levelled against anti-Hispanic ethnocentric misconduct against an attorney employed by the Office of the General Counsel, and other incidents.

Pursuant to Section 910(f) this claim is for damages within the jurisdiction of the unlimited division of the Los Angeles Superior Court.

Respectfully Submitted,

 Dan56 POV bullying 

Hi Khanassassin-

I read your intelligent, and respectuful comments on Aaliyah's talk page.  Unfortunately, Dan56 seems to be trying to control every minute detail which I've edited.  He has reversed anything I do.  My main contention, like yours, is his subjective views on """"Critical Reception.""""  It's simply not true that Aaliyah received """"Highly Positive"""" reviews.  She received """"positive"""" reviews, as you stated, or """"Generally Favorable,"""" according to Metacritic.  If you don't mind, I'd also like to point you to a talk page from Nicki Minaj's album, """"Roman Reloaded.""""  Several editors there accused Dan56 of being """"biased"""" against Minaj, which I'd have to say does seem to be the case.  The Album received a score of 60 from Metacritic, which several editors wanted to show as """"generally positive,"""" because two highly influential reviewers, Rolling Stone and Spin, lauded the album.  Dan56 used Metacritic to """"verify"""" his POV that the album was """"mixed,"""" and then went on to revert any attempts by the editors to inject any positive reviews into the the first paragraph of the """"Critical Reception"""" section.  Here is Dan56's response to me, regarding my attempt to make the correction on Aaliyah:

This was reviewed in FAC (""""excellent"""" is cited in the source). Metacritic is not the be-all, end-all of review sources (they happen to omit several reviews from notable publications that are included in this article that they would now have included, such as Slant Magazine, The Guardian, Chicago Tribune and The Independent). Your other changes were reverted as well.

However, when trying to sway the editors on """"Roman Reloaded,"""" Dan56 says this:

We are being objective, which is why you're revision is not being accepted. You're trying to overemphasis two reviews to make them seem more flattering of the article's subject, and tactlessly rearranging positive criticism ahead of quotes from mixed reviews, which Metacritic clearly shows are the majority (yellow anyone?) 

I simply wanted to note what a score of 76 reflects on Metacritic, and Dan56 will not allow it.  What gives?
Thank you for your time.

To: Chzz
From: Howard Zimmerman

Chzz,

I had just figured out how to deal with References 4 and 5 and got them reasonably set up (at least to start).

But on looking at the article now, I see that the references are somehow in trouble and mixed up.

Another problem somehow developed. The drawing for Figure 1 is oddly placed.
I've attemted to give it more space, but the space is put partially before the caption
and the drawing doesn't move left but is oddly to the right.

Chzz, I appreciate your wanting to help. Especially in view of my uncertainty earlier about the referencing.

But is it possible to get the Article back to where it was this morning. I had just fixed up References 4 and 5.
I realize that I could improve them further but the basic job really was ok.

I think I can put the rest of the references in all right.

But I don't know if the article as it waa this morning is archived and can be retrieved.

If not, I can go through the article and see if I can get the right referencing. 

I haven't figured out exactly what went wrong. 

But Reference 3 should be to Krapcho and Bothner-By

Then Ref 4 should be to the 1961 Tetrahedron article

and Ref 5 to the Interscience 1973 article.

After that Ref 6 should be the Birch and Nasipuri 1959 article.

Chzz, if needed I can go through and experiment with fixing this up.

But I'm a bit uncertain about how to change the referencing although I can try.

AND, I don't know how to move the Drawing in Figure 1 to be to the left and centered.
while it was ok originally, my attempts to move it back haven't worked.

Thus if the article has been archived and can be gotten back, that would be simplest.

Chzz, it does appear that I've been the source of too much work for you. Neverheless
please do realize that I appreciate the help.

Best wishes,

Howard

Nothing is ever lost; the history shows all the previous versions, and all edits, back from when a page was made - see WP:HISTORY, and look at the page history.

I have tried to fix the refs from your description above - hopefully it is a bit better now; it's probably still not right, but considering most of it is correct, it might be easier to work from that. If you would rather just go back to the version before I edited it today though, that's easy enough, as explained above - or, let me know, and I'll put it back for you. Possibly it is easier to fix the existing, and refer back to this version.

Re. the figure, well, this is the problem I've been trying to describe. If you leave a number of blank lines to space the figures, then it might look OK to you, but it won't on another persons browser. You cannot rely on the text being the same size on their system, nor can you expect everyone to use a screen with the same resolution. This is a problem, with inserting images directly, rather than using the thumbnail system.  ►  

Two more things, to make our lives easier;

Please fix your signature, so it stops doing this 'unsigned comments' thing. To do that, click on 'my preferences', clear anything in the """"Signature:"""" box, and make sure that the checkbox """" Sign my name exactly as shown"""" is not checked.

When you make sections here (to leave messages), could you keep the title short? The long titles make it a bit unwieldy in the table of contents etc.

Neither are a huge problem; just trying to make things easier. Hope to hear more soon. [[User talk:Chzz|",0,0,0,0,0,0

My overview

1. Intro: Euskadi ta Askatasuna is translated as Basque Homeland and Freedom, yet Euskadi (a neologism) is surely better translated as Basque Country, in the territorial and political sense of the term """"country"""". The term homeland is kind of totally out of place, as happens in some other article. There's no real equivalent for homeland in Basque or Spanish and sounds very strange. 

2. Aims: Mountolive seemed to insist in claiming (erroneously) that ETA's principal aim is to create a socialist state. This is not real, has been discussed before and can be documented. The current status is ok.

3. Secondary tactical targets: 
Drug traffickers (this has a """"citation needed"""" mark). I can't provide the citation but can say that in the early 80s it was the case. 
I would like a source for the Leitzaran highway, a more recent case, that I think is not so clear though. 
Possibly the complex struggle of Lemoiz nuclear plant needs its own article but well... there are no doubts that at some point ETA took it as their own circustantial fight and actually were decissive in stopping its construction. This may well justify a section of its own for this particular case but a separate article is maybe a better solution.

4. Context: the entry is ok as for now, unless someone has a better idea. There was a minor dispute about wether Askatasuna (former GG.AA./AAT) should be defined as """"anti-repressive"""" or just stated without any explanation. 

5. Social support is a little confuse and maybe POV. There's much emphasis on Francoism, what is surely justified, but the division Navarre+Araba vs. Guipuscoa+Biscay is interpreted from the Francoist POV more or less. After all, whatever the support that fascists had in Navarre and Araba, they fell in that side because of where the coup triumphed. There were only three cities in all Spain where the coup was aborted: Madrid, Barcelona and St. Sebastian (plus partially Toledo and Oviedo), the rest just fell where they got in luck. In this sense sentences like Since some Basque nationalists had sided with the Republican government in the Spanish Civil War, Franco restricted virtually any public expressions of Basque culture... are very tendentious. Francoism attempted and partly suceeded in emphasizing the divisions between the provinces with such tactics as declaring Biscay and Guipuscoa """"traitor provinces"""" but not Madrid, Barcelona, Santander or Murcia, that were also in the Republican side. 

The last paragraph of this section is also confuse. It's not clear what erosion may have suffered """"MLNV"""" (acronym is not clear for the English reader) in recent years. Sources are needed but HB-EH-Batasuna-EHAK support has oscilated between 18% and 12% (in all Southern Basque Country, Navarre included, where this sector is the largest nationalist one), with ups and downs, and is difficult to count in some elections because of the ban on Batasuna and anything of the like. 

The claims on Iparralde are rather false. More than 10% voted nationalist (mostly AB) in latest elections. But regionalism (claim for a separate Basque departement, greater presence of Basque language in administration, economic institutions, etc.) is widespread, being promised by politicians of all parties in each election and rejected by Paris right after them.

6. Tactics: I reviewed this part and mostly is ok. There's the problem of redundancy between tactics and victims and it seems Mountolive had a different approach, that has been partly discussed above.

7. Government response: the treatment of unionist paramilitary groups is too focused on the GAL ignoring once important GCE and BVE) and I'd like to see some material on the following:
Dispersion of ETA prisioners, history of it and its effects on militant prisioners and their relatives and friends (at least a mention to all those dead in car accidents while travelling to visit their imprisioned relatives). 
Recent legal and judicial steps on practical life terms
General replacement of Spanish police corps by Basque Ertzantza (in the BAC) and its influence.

The rest is ok, I think, though maybe the 18/98 procedure and the derivated ones need an article for themselves. I'd like also more info on the closed newspapers, radios and magazines, tortures to journalists of Egunkaria ([http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=10179 reporters sans frontiers 2004 report). 

I think you can retire """"controversial"""" from Garzón - though I insist that he's actually quite controversial in fact, I admit it may break WP:NPOV.

Dear Demize, as per your answer on my talk page, I did make the change, but still the bot is not running ( Can you please check out once more if it is not a concern? —  (talk2me)

The bot runs once a day, so you'll need to wait for that. I believe it runs around 2PM UTC. If it still doesn't work, tell me and I can check it over again for you! mz

 Music 

Hey, a music lover also. Nice to meet you. I play the piano. I was so lucky to get in February 2010 a Steinway & Sons concert grand  built 1877. My favourite music is the ragtime of Scott Joplin which I play since nearly 40 yrs, starting when I was 16 and got my frist piano from a school colleague. My second piano was a G.Adams, Wesel upright which I got from my Bro-in-law who is a professional organist for the catholic churc in GER. This piano served me for 29 yrs and is now in service for an internet girlfriend some 30mls away. And once I sung the barbershop, I was a """"BAD Boy"""" (abbrevation B.A.D. is Barbershop Aus Dortmund (from Dortmund).  There I was in contact to Tom Gentry, barbershop judge and music author living in Cincinnatti, Ohio area. Kind musical regards     ==> AxelKing -)

Apology accepted, however even if the characterization is accurate for other editors, it serves no purpose in bringing it up.  Making disputes personal rarely enhances dialogue.  Anyway, I think you've concluded basically the same thing I have: such a broadening of definition would include many people who really should not be considered philosophers.  Consider, for instance, Ayn Rand.  She wrote on the topics of metaphysics, ethics, etc, but she did so rhetorically and without actually attempting to prove her points using syllogistic logic.  She contributed nothing to human knowledge, both because her reasoning was fallacious and because any of her actually valid conclusions had already been documented by previous philosophers (for instance, """"objectivist"""" metaphysics are simply a renamed naturalistic metaphysics).  I don't mean to group Dawkins with Rand of course as Dawkins is, in my opinion, a brilliant man who has contributed much to human knowledge.  But this is my point: using such a broadened definition puts Dawkins, Rand, Kant, Mill, and Russel in the same category, which I think is prima facie an incorrect grouping.  

Now, as to your point that philosophers will favor their own: well yes, but the same should be said for biologists and physicists.  When we write an article on evolution we value the discoveries of biology and not of religion.  Philosophy is and basically always has been an academic enterprise, starting with the post-religious works of the Sophists/Plato/Aristotle/etc as they founded the world's first philosophical academies.  Since then the practice of philosophy has undergone many manifestations but even among those differences it is generally somewhat easy to tell what is philosophy and what is simply on the subject of philosophy but not actually philosophy.  For instance, the analytical school of philosophy, I think, should not hesitate to consider continental philosophy something other than philosophy, it is just considered to be incorrect (being very general here).  From a Wikipedia standpoint, encyclopedias themselves are an academic enterprise and as such when we're considering how to assign WP:WEIGHT to a subject we do so by reference to experts in that subject.  Whether rightly or wrongly, the experts on philosophy have yet to recognize Dawkins as a philosopher, but as WP editors our job is not to determine whether or not Dawkins is really a philosopher, but rather to consider the expert opinion on the matter and give due weight to minority views when appropriate. talk """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 This was a """"tool"""" 

I'm so tired of archaeologists interpreting anything they don't understand as simply """"art."""" At the very least call it prehistoric crafts, because they were actually utilized in some way. In the case of this figure, it is a prehistoric fertility """"dildo."""" The male deer is coming up behind the female to mount her.

It would be used on the female before copulation because of the increased fertility perceived to coincide with female orgasm. Note the ridging.

Archaeologists historically are afraid to openly discuss the sexual nature of prehistoric crafts. This is why so many things are labeled """"fertility object"""" when they are dildos, plain and simple. Yes, population increases were the larger goal of this.

You know what, forget it. The guy who was repeatedly changing the opening and led me to post what was previously here, because he repeatedly refused to answer the simple question of why (except of course to start SHOUTING) has reported me for not being civil. How ironic is that. Rather than have a long detailed discussion here about which opening is better, I'll simply point out that in the current version, even after you read the entire first paragraph, you still don't have a clue why this article exists. You do find out what Marco Rodríguez does for a living though. So yay for that. I guess once you get to the end, you do get some idea why this has been such a big deal, but that's assuming you haven't fallen asleep, or shot yourself, having read the same four words - Brazil, Germany, biggest & loss (and their million variants), multiple times. Seriously, if people here think what's currently serving as an opening to this article summarises the key points in an engaging and professional way, perhaps you need to get a job where your actually paid to write for a living. It's not quite garbage, but it's not good. And please stop justifying such poor/dull/repetitive/trivial writing with the claim the alternatives are """"unencyclopedic"""", frankly you couldn't be more wrong. There's no serious disagreement out in the world that this defeat was a shock result and a national humiliation - that will be upfront in the key summary of every decent source writing about this match, both now and in 20 years time. If you don't want it to be in this one, please think of a better reason than """"unencyclopedic"""", if only that the victims might have a clue what it is you actually mean.

That said, on the offchance anyone with any ability for writing gets around to working on this article, here's what the opening should look like, if you're trying to engage the reader while summarizing the key points. It's not perfect, but it's a hell of a lot better than the crap people fought tooth and nail to replace it with.

Brazil 1–7 Germany was the shock result of the first semi-final of the 2014 FIFA World Cup men's international football tournament, played on 8 July at the Estádio Mineirão in Belo Horizonte, Brazil. It broke Brazil's 62-match home unbeaten streak in competitive matches going back to 1975, and equalled their biggest margin of defeat, tied with a 6–0 loss to Uruguay in 1920, leading it to be described as a national humiliation. The game also saw Germany score the most goals in World Cup history, their 223 overtaking Brazil's 221. Their second goal meant Germany's Miroslav Klose reached 16 World Cup goals, overtaking Brazil's Ronaldo as the tournament's all-time record goalscorer. The game was subsequently referred to by the press as the Mineirazo, evoking the spirit of the Maracanazo in which Brazil unexpectedly lost the 1950 FIFA World Cup on home soil to Uruguay.

 Hi Duxwing,
 Sorry for the very long response time.  The sentence """"a Y such that Z exists for X"""" is much harder to decipher than the other version and because of the nontraditional order of quantifiers; in some cases it may have different meaning as a mathematical statement.  (It is also not noticably more concise.)  For example, the sentence """"An element −v ∈ V for every v ∈ V exists"""" is impossible to parse because of the strange quantifier placement.  I suggest that if you are not familiar enough with higher mathematics to understand the importance of precision in quantifier choice and order then you should tread very carefully when editing technical phrases.  (Some of the other edits you made were unobjectionable or improvements, but they were all mixed in together and I didn't want to risk leaving an incorrect technical phrase.)

All I can state is that the novel has Elphinstone as the rank I stated, but quite possibly that was a literary tweak in order to make Christian the only Master's Mate. I'm certainly not going to claim the fictional variant is correct and all the non-fictional versions are wrong! Now that I look at Elphinstone's and Churchill's ages, Elphinstone (at 36) is 8 years older than Churchill (at 28) so it is unlikely, but by no means impossible, that Elphinstone was junior in rank to Churchill.  To be honest, I'm a bit confused why there would be 2 Master's Mates on the same ship with so small a crew - is that normal?  That would make it the only rank on the Bounty for which there was more than one instance other than quartermaster (and of course, able seaman!).  Anyway, I don't want to get stuck on this issue - I had asked who you the other Master's Mate was and you told me. My response to your reply is now a bit of a digression, but hopefully an informative one. Let's move on. Granted that Elphinstone is indeed a Master's Mate, the number of crew not berthed in the forecastle in point (5) below is now 15 not 14, which is still greater than 13. 66.16.144.18",0,0,0,0,0,0

Well, thank you for your comprehensive answer. You certainly didn't need to provide an explanation and I'm sorry if I gave you that impression, but your comments explain a lot so there is some value there. Circumstances like yours can cause problems when we have guidelines like WP:QUACK; I'm sure you understand what I mean.

I'm not an admin and so can't (and wouldn't) really close the AFD, though as a non-admin I can re-list it to encourage more people to look at the article and did. My impression at this stage is that most editors seem to think Mr Roberts doesn't meet our general notability guideline because he hasn't received enough coverage in reliable sources. That he has won an award for his blog wouldn't normally make him notable unless it was a very significant award. Winning a notable award doesn't necessarily make someone notable either. But it's also possible that someone who isn't notable now, might very well be notable in the future. We call that WP:TOOSOON. In cases like that, the best bet would be to ask for the article to be userfied which means it is moved to your own user space until the subject is notable enough for the article to be published in the main article space. I have a couple of articles like that sitting in my own userspace. 

At the end of the day, it's not really about """"protecting"""" an article from deletion, it's about the Wikipedia community protecting the encyclopaedia from the inclusion of everyone and everything, ever. So we set and adhere to particular standards and things that don't meet those standards (even things that might one day meet them) are deleted. My best suggestion would be that you spend some time editing the articles of some very obviously notable people before trying to create articles for people who might not be. That way, if one of your articles is taken to AFD, at least you'll have a much broader understanding of policy and deletion procedures. At the moment you seem to be fighting a losing battle and that can be very upsetting, especially if people are throwing all sorts of linked acronyms at you that you've never seen. 111 """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Dear Mr. Lawrence or Mr. Ramirez or whoever you may be:

Thank you for your email, but I prefer to keep Wikipedia business on Wikipedia, not in private communication, so I will respond here.

Your email to me requesting your IP address be unblocked failed to instill any trust. You claim to be one person (Lawrence), yet you send me email from an address that clearly belongs to another (Ramirez)? Are all accounts at your organization as compromised as your Wikipedia account has been?

You state """"It is not possible for me to set up another account on another IP address because this is my IP address."""" No, it is not your IP address. It belongs to your organization. And your organization has lost the trust of the Wikipedia community, with its history of promotional edits and multiple people accessing the same account.

Each in turn

Suggested: In physics, force is the perceptible cause of the acceleration of a mass (change in the rate or direction of its motion) and is experienced as a push or a pull. instead of In physics, force is what causes a mass to accelerate experienced as a push or a pull.
The addition of """"and"""" is good. However, a force need not be """"perceived"""" to exist. The definition of """"acceleration"""" is indeed confusing to the lay person, but I think that the wikilink on acceleration covers it. We need to be careful to not go overboard in description in the lead.
Provide definition: """"momentum (quantity of motion)""""
Hmm, this isn't exactly an accurate definition of momentum since momentum is, in fact, both mass and motion. Again, the wikilink I think should suffice, but maybe we can reword things without providing definitions to make it clearer. I want this to be intelligible, but I'm afraid that including these points might be confusing for many and an annoyance to even more.
Following the development of quantum mechanics, it is now understood that momentum is a fundamental property of particles and that, according to the standard model of particle physics, changes in momentum are the consequence of the net emission or absorption by particles of momentum-carrying gauge bosons. Effects which are at the macro level experienced as a """"force"""" are the consequence of the aggregate effect of these boson-mediated fundamental interactions. In modern physics, only four fundamental interactions are known; in order of decreasing strength, they are: strong, electromagnetic, weak, and gravitational.[1] High-energy particle physics observations in 1970s and 1980s confirmed that the weak and electromagnetic forces are expressions of a unified electroweak interaction. No gauge boson has yet been demonstrated for mediating the gravitational interaction and what is perceived as the """"force"""" of gravity is more accurately attributable to the the effect of distortions by massive bodies of the curvature of spacetime as explicated in Einstein's Theory of General Relativity.
There is a slight issue here with the sentence: """"Effects which are at the macro level experienced as a """"force"""" are the consequence of the aggregate effect of these boson-mediated fundamental interactions."""" This sentence misses the fact that forces also exist on the micro level. A single boson-mediated fundamental interaction often has a """"force"""" associated with it. For example, an electron accelerates because it emits a photon: this is due to the electromagnetic force acting on the electron. One micro-interaction: still a force since a mass accelerated.

I will implement the wording I think is good, but let's keep discussing the problematic wording.

 Neo-Nazis on Wikipedia  

With so much information online, there is a big need for encyclopedias. Wikipedia is not the answer.  Wikipedia has writers and administrators who squash the truth.   They are anti libertarian and they glorify totalitarianism with their Nazi-style behavior.  Wikipedia’s lies are so infamous that it has inspired a nationwide boycott, especially for the apparent Neo-Nazism of some of its more rabid writers.  

Wikipedia writers prevent any mention of the new historical discovery that the USA was the source of the Nazi salute. The USA's first Pledge used a straight-arm salute and it was the origin of the salute of the monstrous National Socialist German Workers' Party (Nazis), as shown by Dr. Rex Curry.  It was not an ancient Roman salute. Professor Curry helped to establish that it was not an ancient Roman salute, and that the """"ancient Roman salute"""" is a myth. A image search on the web for the “original pledge of allegiance” provides additional information.

The Pledge began with a military salute that then stretched out toward the flag. Due to the way that both gestures were used, the military salute led to the Nazi salute. The Nazi salute is an extended military salute. Additional information is available in web searches for the text """"military salute became the Nazi salute.""""

Francis Bellamy (author of the """"Pledge of Allegiance"""") and Edward Bellamy (author of the novel """"Looking Backward"""") and Charles Bellamy (author of """"A Moment of Madness"""") were socialists.  Edward and Charles were brothers, and Francis was their cousin. Francis and Edward were both self-proclaimed National Socialists and they supported the """"Nationalism"""" movement in the USA, the """"Nationalist"""" magazine, the """"Nationalist Educational Association,"""" and their dogma of """"military socialism,"""" and Edward inspired the """"Nationalist Party"""" (in the USA) and their dogma influenced socialists in Germany, and the Pledge was the origin of the Nazi salute. """"Nazi"""" means """"National Socialist German Workers' Party."""" A mnemonic device is the swastika. Although the swastika was an ancient symbol, Professor Curry discovered that it was also used sometimes by German National Socialists to represent """"S"""" letters for their """"socialism.""""  Hitler altered his own signature to use the same stylized """"S"""" letter for """"socialist"""" and similar alphabetic symbolism still shows on Volkswagens. """"  Additional information is available in image or text searches for “swastika secrets.” 

Dr. Curry showed that many modern myths about swastikas are based on the false belief that Nazis called their symbol a """"swastika.""""  German National Socialists did not use the word """"swastika,"""" but called their symbol a """"Hakenkreuz.""""  

Recently, one Wikipedia writer became wiser and improved the """"Roman salute"""" article somewhat so that it recognizes and repeats some of Rex Curry's discoveries. Other pledge and salute articles on Wikipedia are as bad as ever.

The Wikipedia article for the """"Roman salute"""" used to be complete disinformation, deliberately maintained by phonies who tried to perpetuate myths. Here is an excerpt of what Wikipedia used to carry: """"The Roman salute is a closed finger, flat-palm-down hand raised at an angle (usually 45 degrees) and was used by the Roman Republic. It was also the historical civilian salute of the United States, from 1787?-1934?, known since 1892 as the Bellamy salute. It was also the historical salute among armies of the Middle East and South America."""" Wikipedia liars also used the painting """"The Oath of the Horatii"""" as absurd support for a Roman connection. The foregoing is all incorrect and of course without any attribution nor support on the Wikipedia page because there is no support. It is not a Roman salute.  Yet, Wikipedia regulars allowed the disinformation, including the dates “1787?-1934?” with the question marks included, to remain posted on Wikipedia, while deleting anyone who tried to correct the propaganda.

Similar criticisms apply to the Wikipedia pages on Francis Bellamy, Edward Bellamy and the Pledge of Allegiance.

Wikipedia falsifiers use the misnomer """"public schools"""" when they mean """"government schools"""" and they both cover-up the Bellamys' desire to promote a government takeover of education, a desire to end all of the better alternatives, and to impose socialism (and what the Bellamys called """"military socialism"""") within government schools. The Bellamys loved the military and wanted all of society to ape the military. Those points also help explain why Francis Bellamy enjoyed starting the pledge with a military salute.

Some regular writers on Wikipedia knowingly engage in personal attacks and deletions (even of links) of anyone who explains the connection between Edward Bellamy and his cousin Francis Bellamy (author of the pledge of",0,0,0,0,0,0

I'm firmly on the side of the Republic  one of the first things I ever learned to say in Spanish was """"Sueño y una ametralladero y Franco se va paseo,  but this Wikipedia articles are not the place for partisan polemic. A chronology this detailed should also include the anti-Catholic atrocities by anarchists and other supporters of the Republic. This doesn't.
The material is written in indifferent English. Right now, I'm engaged in a copy edit, which is being made difficult by the size of this article and the current miserable state of the servers.
I do not think it is appropriate in Wikipedia to repeatedly refer to the Nationalists as """"the Fascists"""".  Would I call them that in my own writing outside Wikipedia? Sure. And someone on the Right would probably use different words than """"Republicans"""", """"legitimate government"""", etc. in his/her own writing. Here, I'd favor """"Nationalists"""" or """"Insurgents"""" almost everywhere that the article currently says """"Fascists"""". Does anyone want to present an argument to the contrary?
Anyway, I'm trying to clean this all up. Suggestions are welcome. So is help. I'm not sure how much time I'll have for this  it's not my main focus within Wikipedia, and I suspect that (for entirely good reasons) I may soon have a lot less time for Wikipedia than I've lately had.   | Talk 23:25, Jan 19, 2005 (UTC)""",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Controversial Cupboard 

I have very little time left now for major work here so I propose making a subsection of this, my talk page, since it's getting a teency weency bit long now. (171 kilobytes)

The first cupboard will be entitled """"Irish Terrorism/Politics"""" and I propose moving whole sections of my talk page into it - if there are no vehement and persuasive objections. I'll keep the same chronological order, but these are the sections I plan on moving in their entirety:- 
    * 7 Stop canvassing!
    * 8 Gaimhreadhan
    * 9 Sockpuppetry block
    * 10 Unblocked
    * 17 Result of PIRA investigation
    * 20 Jean McConville
    * 21 You have been blocked
    * 28 Trim
    * 29 User talk:Tyrenius
    * 38 Blocked
    * 39 Gaimhreadhan's Block
    * 40 Your post on my talk page
    * 41 Legal threat
    * 46 Block
          o 46.1 Infallibility
    * 48 Block reduced

I estimate that this """"housekeeping""""/censorship will reduce this page's size by more than 65% and make it more manageable for those of readers who use dial up modems and/or are moaning.

I realise that some of these sections are not wholly concerned with """"Irish Terrorism/Politics"""" but all have comments that could be categorised as such and I did not wish to separate comment and riposte, in so far as that is practically possible....Gaimhreadhan (kiwiexile at DMOZ) talk  • """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Hello, sorry for the long message.

In March 2005, there was a WP:RM request and vote (which you took part in) to move Úbeda to Ubeda, with a 6-3 result, see  Talk:Ubeda#Requested_move:_.C3.9Abeda_.E2.86.92_Ubeda (or perhaps here if renamed).

However, beginning in April 2005 and lasting several months, there was a survey conducted at Wikipedia talk:Naming conventions (use English)#Proposal and straw poll regarding place names with diacritical marks, with dozens of participants voting and discussing over an extended period of time.  The purpose of the survey was to try to gather feedback for what the policy should be globally.  Proponents of diacritics were in the majority, and in general, use of diacritics is widespread in actual practice on Wikipedia today (particularly since the Mediawiki upgrade to Unicode).

However, for Úbeda/Ubeda, Philip Baird Shearer is stating that the WP:RM vote takes precedence over the survey results, and a new WP:RM vote would be required to move it to Úbeda.  My position is that there should be a global policy rather than case-by-case voting  that was the whole purpose of the survey.  In discussion with him, I wrote:
Just as we wouldn't have case-by-case voting on, say, capitalization issues for articles (eg, prepositions in movie and book titles should be lowercase, globally), we shouldn't have case-by-case voting on diacritic issues.
See the discussion at Talk:Ubeda#Talk_page_discussion_on_page_move (or perhaps here if renamed).

As a possible alternative to calling a new WP:RM vote which might set a precedent for case-by-case voting across thousands of articles, I am polling all the participants of the original WP:RM vote to ask:
 Regardless of how you voted in the WP:RM voting, which do you believe should take precedence: the earlier WP:RM vote on the specific article, or the subsequent survey?

Note, since Philip Baird Shearer was one of the participants in that vote, he will also be receiving this message and thus will have the opportunity to respond.",0,0,0,0,0,0

Will the merge reduce the quality or coherence of the target article?

If the answer to either of these questions is """"yes"""", it is probably better to avoid merging or redirecting. Instead, consider improving it, or offer suggestions for its improvement on the talk page

Have these stubs been tagged for Notability or Sources and allowed to grow?

I'm not following Dennis' logic here. The reference entirely supports the information in the National alliance article (and by the way, that newspaper is at least a worthy enough source as the defunct obscure newspaper where Redwood's letter to the editor appeared that is quoted at length. This is what the Friedman article says:

He also suggested consulting with Political Research Associates (PRA), a left-liberal investigative outfit with deep roots in the counterintelligence movement. Among its top researchers is former Public Eye editor Chip Berlet. PRA has been funded, in large part, by Richard Denis-a multi-millionaire Chicago commodities trader who was also one of the largest individual contributors to the Democratic Party in 1993. Bragging that he and researchers had worked with PRA """"for many years,"""" King said: """"They have the best files in the country on political cults.""""
.........
Berlet, like King, has suspiciously changed his public views on NAP over the years. In 1984, when he first took over as editor of Public Eye, Berlet told Newman in a phone interview set up at Berlet's request to set the record straight regarding the Public Eye's 1977 accusation that Newman was a cultist and a LaRouchite, """"I'm the new kid on the block at Public Eye. I'm the new editor as opposed to the old editor, and if there was some way I could avoid having to write articles about this ongoing topic [NAP], I would. Our analysis of your group has changed over the past few years, drastically with my assumption to editor."""" The next issue of Public Eye contained the following editor's note: """"As you will learn from a forthcoming article on Fred Newman and the IWP [International Workers Party, a group that Newman had headed up in the mid seventies], the Public Eye no longer feels it is accurate to call Newman's political network a cult.""""
That """"forthcoming"""" article, however, never appeared. Instead, three years later, right after Democratic Party high roller Denis contributed $75,000 to PRA, Berlet's Clouds Blur the Rainbow did.
The article clearly cites this in a NPOV manner as a claim that was made in a Newman publication, not as  fact, just like the claims of Redwood and every other critic and self-styled """"expert"""" whose opinions permeate this article to a ridiculous extent already.  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Request for Clarification

Hello, Arthur Rubin (congratulations on your recent promotion to admin here at Wikipedia!). Your friend the Hillman agent seems to be MIA, so I'll be waiting until he/she/it gets back to renew my discussions with him/her/it. But as it happens, I just noticed that you responded to me in the CTMU AfD as follows:
 
""""The only kind of theory capable of 'resolving an intractable paradox of physical science' is a theory formulated on a level above that of the paradox itself; thus, using the theory, one can define a function which resolves the paradox by mapping its (otherwise conflicting) elements consistently into observables. [That was me; now here's you:] WP:BOLLOCKS. Well, perhaps, not, but no such (intractable) paradox is discussed here. — Arthur Rubin | (talk) ."""" 

I'm very sorry that I wasn't able to respond to you when you made that comment - too much going on for me to notice it at the time, I'm afraid. But now that it has come to my attention, I'm struck by its ambiguity. Do you mean that science generates no intractable paradoxes in the conventional or computational sense? (If so, I'd like to know how you've managed to deduce this.) Do you mean that such paradoxes may in fact exist, but that the resolutions are necessarily scientific as opposed to interpretative? (If so, I'd again like to know your reasoning.) Or do you simply mean that the CTMU - an unquestionably notable theory which was covered by large-circulation elements of the popular media, but whose Wikipedia article you nevertheless helped to delete - doesn't have anything to do with such paradoxes? 

I ask, of course, because you are a """"relatively famous Wikipedian"""" who participated in getting that article deleted, and as an important mathematician, must understand quite a bit indeed! More importantly, because you have taken it upon yourself to help arbit the math-science-pseudomath/science-philosophy distinction here at Wikipedia, I think we all need to make sure that you thoroughly understand it, and are not letting misconceptions contribute to possible conflicts of interest on the parts of other Wikipedians.

 Taking this to your own talk page as you don't seem quite as keen on listening to what I've got to say over on my page as you are hellbent on defiling everyone's edits for your enjoyment 

Alright, I've just had it up to here with you and your blasphemous claims of everyone's edits being """"unreferenced crap"""" because you're the only one who can't remain content of having others contribute to the site. I can put up with your labels of every edit you find disastisfactory to your bigoted tastes as """"vandalism,"""" but going through everyone's freaking contributions list to make it some White Man's Burden to undo every small trimmings of blatantly incorrect or dingy information is just pushing the line, so I suggest you don't break the 3-edit rule yourself if you're so pompously insisting the rules and law enforcements here are on your side.

Let's see back where this started in the Freeza section, for example. Like I said on my edits page, I haven't familiarized myself with making those neat little references at the bottom to add to my edits, so in straight, bold text as clear as day, I posted the chapter number where the psychic ability itself was displayed, and could well post an image to back up my claims, while each and every one of the rest of the information I posted was seen throughout his extended fight sequences with Goku and co., you can bet your money on it; it's not Berserk or Blade of the Immortal we're talking about here, but plain-out, simple everyday Dragonball, which everyone (save you) would be fully capable of seeing. 

Then, the Vegeta article? Please, Vegeta himself professed about the 17 million zenos required to initiate his Ozaru transformation which can only be produced by a full moon or his power ball that mixes with the planet's oxygen to create a replacement, which both he and Gohan used to transform, and after his tail was sliced off by Yajirobe, he fled to the Freeza Planet and stated that his tail would grow back after he came out of the healing tank with the tail stump in plain view. None of this is uncited information by any means, and you're well striking a chord with everyone's anger by hellbenting on removing all that on the crappy pretense that because you can't deal with someone else making contributions, you're right in labeling them """"unreferenced crap"""" or """"vandal"""" and digging through everyone's records like a 40-year old wanker to annul every effort.

And again, the Piccolo article? I simply added that Nail was the one he first fused with to gain his """"massive increase"""" and that he was the one who kicked Freeza away to help buy time for Goku's Genki Dama to charge, and I myself removed some so-called """"crap"""" information like """"Piccolo's bukujutsu being a different technique"""" when the Japanese manga simply states that his technique is a superior kind. What little others there were (my contributions, I mean) are simple, medial additions like """"scientist Gero"""" added to the unclear information that simply said """"Red Ribbon"""" at first, when it was just the one guy and nobody else that was working for vengeance. 

And finally, I've been on this site since back in 2005 or 6 or so since I was 14 and fully know my rules and qualifications, and haven't been blocked once, so I'd suggest that you take it to my profile if you've got such a beef with my edits that you need to act like a petulant, 4-year old child who wants his toy back destroying everyone's contributions on your whim when you yourself are no authority.

He is showing signs of dislike for a particular race, otherwise one will not try deliberately attempt to tarnish the image of one race. It's not part of ordinary edits because we don't find it with anyother countries.

Once you understand that most of the false claims from Debian and it's sockpuppets are based on attempts to reverse the timeline (in order to confuse cause and reaction) it is easy to look for hints that prove claims from Debian as false. You also need to know that there is absolutely no evidence for the claims from Debian. Repeating a false claim thousands of times does not make it correct, but Debian just uses copies of their false claims to """"proove"""" their claims. So what remains? The only provable facts are that Debian started to attack cdrtools in spring 2004 and that Debian at the same time stopped distributing the original cdrtools in favor of their own defective fork from spring 2004 that was later reamed (on my instructions) in autumn 2006. No license problem was ever proven. Most Linux distros ship cdrtools. The larger distros even asked their lawyers for an OK that of course was given.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Seasons Greetings,

This is in reference to a relatively new umbrella article on en-wikipedia named Ceremonial pole. Ceremonial pole is a human tradition since ancient times; either existed in past at some point of time, or still exists in some cultures across global continents from north to south & from east to west. Ceremonial poles  are used to symbolize a variety of concepts in several different world cultures. 

Through article Ceremonial pole we intend to take encyclopedic note of cultural aspects and festive celebrations around Ceremonial pole as an umbrella article and want to have historical, mythological, anthropological aspects, reverence or worships wherever concerned as a small part.

While Ceremonial poles have a long past and strong presence but usually less discussed subject. Even before we seek translation of this article in global languages, we need to have more encyclopedic information/input  about Ceremonial poles from all global cultures and languages. And we seek your assistance in the same.

Since other contributors to the article are insisting for reliable sources and Standard native english; If your contributions  get deleted (for some reason like linguistics or may be your information is reliable but unfortunately dosent match expectations of other editors)  , please do list the same on Talk:Ceremonial pole page so that other wikipedians may help improve by interlanguage collaborations, and/or some other language wikipedias may be interested in giving more importance to reliablity of information over other factors on their respective wikipedia.

> The Oohashi et al. (2006) results reveal some interesting contradictions. While full bandwidth sound was preferred to CD limited bandwidth (over a speaker), the test for the ultrasonic music band was inaudible when reproduced alone. Additionally, the preference for HFC was not replicated when using headphones, only with speaker presentation, ruling out the ear as the means by which the effect was produced. 



These are not contradictions. They are an essential feature of the study, specified and discussed in the paper. There is no contradiction here. Out it goes.(  )

 Contrary evidence and ABX tests 

Oohashi et al. pictured human brains when the test persons were either exposed or not exposed to ultrasonic stimulus. ABX tests only tell, what differences test persons consciously perceive or not during the test. If same research methods had been used and results were drastically different, that should be called contradictory.   
I will state that even more generally than previous: There are certainly many signals and irritants that human beings can be unconsciously exposed to, but nevertheless they affect human's well-being and happiness. For example several chemicals or radioactivity would do that. We just don't know the whole truth about ultrasonic signals yet.

Hey folks, since there's two users in this talk I'll just thread this here.

Seemed obvious to me that this was more than Wikinews, which is why I skipped the discussion phase.

Not enough in-line citations
Perhaps you might like to comment on my stance over here?  

 re:Image:AnotherVersionofthePast.jpg 

I saw your post to ^demon regarding this image. I cannot undelete the image because of WP:FUC #3.b. The image has not been reduced in size. I also believe it fails #2 in that it directly competes with the commercial opportunities of the copyright holder. #8 is also jumping out at me, because the summarized text in the article serves the same purpose as the image. There is not critical commentary about the design of the sight or visual representation of the image in the article Chronology of the Year Zero alternate reality game. Therefore, the exact image you uploaded isn't appropriate for use on wikipedia, and a cropped or reduced size image may theoretically be appropriate, but in the proposed article would just be decorative (and against out non-free content policy). Sorry, but I hope this explanation helps.- [talk] 
Thanks very much for the reply.  I understand your Fair-Use concerns, and hopefully I can address all of them.
FUC 3.b - Agreed.  If the image is undeleted I'd be happy to reduce it's size and upload the smaller version, but I can't really do that (download the high resolution version) until it is undeleted.
FUC #2 - There are no commercial opportunities at stake here.  Because of the odd nature of the website, as part of an alternate reality game, the only logical copyright holder would be either Nine Inch Nails, 42 Entertainment, or Interscope records.  No one is making any money off of these websites: in fact, they officially have absolutely no connection to any company, not even to the album (Year Zero (album)) that it is parallel to.  Reznor himself has stated the ARG is NOT a promotional device.  (see Year Zero (alternate reality game) for more info on that)
FUC #8 - Although the dates themselves are similar, the text is not.  The whole point of the originating website, Another Version of the Past is that there are multiple perspectives of past events.  The text in the WP article is a dry, point-for-point account: """"neutral"""" if you will.  The two versions of the time line presented on the website represent both extremes of the fictional issues at hand: pro-American, pro-government, etc and on the other hand extremist, rebellious, reformatory, etc.  The image provides the user an opportunity to see the POV/agendas at work and compare it to what actually happened.  For example the New Orleans floods are described as a """"Faith-based disaster"""" on one hand, and """"Why Bother with New Orleans?"""" on the other.  
I still believe the image wouldn't be appropriate here. The site the image came from is copyrighted, and was used to promote the album (for the record company executives), regardless what Reznor said, so FUC#2 still concerns me, and I'm not convinced of FUC#8 either. We can simply quote snippets of text without showing it if we want to discuss how the timeline is presented. We'd need to discuss visual aspects of how things look in order to show an image, IMO. I have asked another admin who is more versed in image policy to comment here, so be patient for a 2nd opinion. Thanks for your reply.- [talk] 

Greetings. I was asked to comment here. This image is essentially text, with decorative flourishes. As such, I don't see how  it could pass WP:NFCC#8, which requires that a non-free image provide encyclopedic information beyond what text alone could convey. I don't believe that the text alone, quoted, would be less informative than the image. (And I think that much text, quoted verbatim, would be a copyright violation, which is another indicator that this image isn't allowed.) All the best, –  (talk) (random) 
Ok, fair enough.  I know better than to argue with two admins. =)  Thanks for taking the time to review the case.

 Copied from Blue Ball 
(The issues of this language are unrelated to disambiguation, but should be consistent with the article Blue balls.)

The following appears on Blue Ball but is more efficient to discuss here:
""""Blue balls"""" is a modern slang term for a minor cramping men may get in the groin after they are sexually stimulated for a prolonged period but do not ejaculate.
(t) 21:28, 2004 Mar 16 (UTC)

Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary conforms to common sense usage in saying a cramp is """"a painful spasmodic muscular contraction"""", and the groin does have muscles.  But blue balls is not a cramp, but an ache in the testicles (whose musculature is insignificant at most).  Ellis emphasizes """"congestion"""", which i take to imply that the pain reflects failure to release the eleveated local blood pressure resulting from failure to relieve the engorgement of the genitals that is crucial to erection, i.e., a condition related to the """"pain and tenderness"""" of priapism.  (It may be informative to consult side-effects information of Viagra and its competitors, some of which are effective for 3 days and advise medical care for erections lasting over 4 hours.) (t) 21:28, 2004 Mar 16 (UTC)

Further, the term ejaculate, like the earlier """"release semen"""" (that a well-intentioned editor  used to replace simply """"release""""), misleadingly suggests that fluid pressure of seminal fluid is at issue; i think research will show that there is no significant seminal pressure except that imposed in pulses by the prostate during ejaculation.  The real issue is indeed plain """"release"""", or rather release of either sympathetic or parasympathetic (never could remember which is which) nervous-system excitation, which in turn entails destimulation of sphincter-like structures that sustain the engorgement (and that ED-medications work by affecting).

This needed to be clarified since there has been a problem with him inserting subsequent posts ahead of mine, which can be misleading to a reader.

As you know, having replied there before, this matter is already being discussed here, two headings up.  Perhaps the two heading should be merged to prevent confusion.  I'd hate for someone to stumble on this """"Recent Karwynn deletions heading and, by no intention of your own, think that I deleted disputed material without discussing it on the talk page.  Either way, here's what I have to say about the matter.  I know it's long, but bear with me - you might find the rambling actually makes some sense.

Weasel Words
Your examples of improving weasel statements should be appreciated for what they are, but unfortunately, they don't really apply here.  The full process you linked to involved escalating from """"some say"""" to """"BUsh's critics"""" to """"Michael Moore"""" followed by accounts of a specific statement, namely, Moore's letter to Bush.  Here, that process has not been fully employed.  Unlike the specifically referenced Moore letter to Bush, which was direct and obvious in who it represented, these sources themselves still contain weasel words; take this sentence: A White House long accused of squelching internal dissent and ignoring outside viewpoints.  Accused by whom?  As I said before, just because weasel words are sourced, even directly quoted, doesn't make them ok.  n your example, the weasel words were eliminated by referencing the source of criticism directly.  """"Michael Moore said whatever"""".  In this case, we still haven't discovered who is doing all the accusing.  To say that the Washington Post is making the accusation is inaccurate.  To say that the Washington Post says that Bush has been """"long accused"""" is an accurate weasel statement, not worthy of inclusion in an encyclopedia.  It fails verifiability as well, come to think of it: the article certainly doesn't bother to support the sentence.  Read it for yourself.  They just throw it out there.  Verifiability doesn't mean """"you can find it somewhere else"""", it means """"It's been or can be verified to be true"""".  Perhaps it can be, but this article doesn't do it.  Do you see the difference between this case and the example provided in the WP:AWW guideline?  In the guideline's example, the weasel words were overcome by citing.  In this case, they still remain, because they are inherent in the source itself.

Citing the opinions of these articles
Well, this problem should speak for itself.  Opinions, including those of journalists, should not be cited as support for a claim.  It would be one thing if these criticisms were being mentioned to verify their existence (see Laura Ingraham, an article in which numerous criticisms are used to self-verify, but not used to support a claim within the article that Laura Ingraham is good or bad or this or that), as they are for many public figures, but they are being used as support for this """"particularly notable because"""" statement.  As I said before, which was ignored this... well, I'll just repost what I said before.
It's not a neutral article, nor is it a notably important surce. It's just another source. I could find an article that says something along the lines of """"Stephen Colbert proved that he is a manipulative, arrogant polemicist who cares nothing for social graces and only wishes to make a name for himself by being extreme and controversial"""", and if I stuck that sentence in the article's main body and referenced it, it would be (rightly) reverted before long. The same if I found an article saying that the accusations against Bush being intolerant of dissention were just a knee-jerk criticism and a political tool, lacking any merit. We shouldn't be able to throw political commentary into articles without restraint based on the premise that it's """"sourced"""". This entire statement contains non-neutral commentary about the performance; I don't care if it came from somewhere else, it's still not neutral to include it.
So here are my thoughts on this point, summed up.
Citing opinions is fine for verifying the existence of those opinions/criticisms, but not for supporting the Wikipedia article's opinionated claims (which, see above, shouldn't be in there in the first place).
This article is not notable to the subject matter.  It's very broad, compared to the narrowness of the article's subject (and, even narrower, it's notability and the cause of it).  The specific criticisms are not uncommon, and the article's themselves are not controversial.  They are not important enough to be set apart as evidence pertaining to the performance's notability and Bush's reputation.  Additionally, the source is more focuse",0,0,0,0,0,0

 The lies in how he built the clock

""""His father, Mohamed Elhassan Mohamed, said that on Monday morning, September 14, 2015, he drove his son to school and encouraged him to display his technological ability.[4]

In an interview on Al Jazeera's Ali Velshi on Target, Mohamed said the clock was """"built from scrap around the house"""" and that """"some of the boards were already manufactured.""""[5] He told Larry Wilmore on The Nightly Show that it took him """"10 or 20 minutes"""" to put it together and that he has built more complicated items, but that the clock was simple, using some parts that were scrapped off so that it was easier.[6] According to the initial report in The Dallas Morning News, he had done this """"before bed on Sunday.

Nowhere is there a paragraph underneath that should write """"While Ahmed claims he built the clock from """"scrap"""", it is well known among tech enthusiasts that it is simply the components of a digital clock with no cover.

 This media may be deleted.

Thanks for uploading Image:Chilean 1973 Junta.jpg. I notice the 'image' page currently doesn't specify who created the content, so the copyright status is therefore unclear. If you have not created this media yourself then you need to argue that we have the right to use the media on Wikipedia (see copyright tagging below). If you have not created the media yourself then you should also specify where you found it, i.e., in most cases link to the website where you got it, and the terms of use for content from that page.

If the media also doesn't have a copyright tag then you must also add one. If you created/took the picture, audio, or video then you can use  to release it under the GFDL. If you believe the media qualifies as fair use, please read fair use, and then use a tag such as  or one of the other tags listed at Wikipedia:Image copyright tags#Fair_use.  See Wikipedia:Image copyright tags for the full list of copyright tags that you can use.

If you have uploaded other media, please check that you have specified their source and copyright tagged them, too. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on the """"my contributions"""" link (it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in), and then selecting """"Image"""" from the dropdown box.

When you found out about who I was, you teased me, insulted me behind my back and through e-mail, etc., etc., which is why I have become so angered with the community. Is this really necessary? Yes, you are certainly allowed to do whatever you want but some comments just pushed my buttons, which is why from time to time I exhibited infinite and random stupidity. Of course I am going to admit this — because I did. No, an arbitration will not be necessary because I am leaving the second We Belong Together finishes FAC and this is not a lie. Will I return? Maybe. I am not going to be present throughout late June–late September (I'll be studying elsewhere in the world). Therefore, I will not be making edits on Wikipedia during this time. However, following September, I might come back. Just do me this one favour: if you find out who I am (if I return), please don't tease me and do the things you have done; that was why I became uncivil and angered.

3fe4393addcc62f4,"This page is dedicated to the Gnome Owl.
MEASUREMENTS: The Northern Pygmy-Owl has a body length of 7 - 8 inches, a wingspan of 15 - 16 inches, and weighs about 2 - 2 1/2 ounces.  
HABITAT: This owl can be found at forest edges near meadows, lakes, coastline, and forest clearings in deciduous and coniferous forests of western North and Central America.  
DIET: The main diet of the Northern Pygmy-Owl is small birds and rodents, and large insects. Occasionally, they will eat reptiles and amphibians. Pygmy-owls are diurnal(active during the day) and crepuscular (active at dusk and dawn) hunters. This owl will search for prey from a perch, pouncing upon it from a close distance when prey is found. 
REPRODUCTION: The Northern Pygmy-Owl nests in tree cavities. The female usually lays 3 - 5 eggs. Unlike most owls, which start incubating the eggs soon after the first eggs are laid, the pygmy-owl does not start incubation until all the eggs have been laid. In about 29 days all the chicks hatch within a short time of each other. The young owlets fledge at 30 days and are independent of parental care 20 - 30 days later. The young owls become sexually mature in less than a year.  
NAME DERIVATION: The scientific name comes from the Greek words glaux, indicating a little owl; glaukidion, meaning to gleam or glare, and may refer to the eyes of the owl; and gnoma, referring to knowledge, reasoning, or an opinion. The common name indicates the size of the bird and its northern range. This owl has also been called a Gnome Owl. 
INTERESTING FACTS: 
Unlike hawks, falcons, and eagles, owls do not have an expandable part of the esophagus, called a crop, to store extra food. Therefore owls, like pygmy-owls, will cache the remainder of their food in a hiding place and eat it later. This is especially important for small, high-energy species that must eat frequently.

Since pygmy-owls are active during daylight, they rely on their sense of sight to hunt. Consequently, this owl did not develop a good sense of hearing, silent flight, nor exceptional night vision, like nocturnal owls.",0,0,0,0,0,0

To quote the Wikipedia article on shepherds, """"A shepherd is one who takes care of sheep, usually in flocks in the fields... Unlike farmers, shepherds were often wage earners, being paid to watch the sheep of others."""" The 1960s weren't Biblical times. Shepherding had long since become one of those crappy jobs that down-and-out laborers got when they could get it. In fact, that's an important part of Proulx's story, characterizing them as a particular kind of wretched of the earth. Calling them cowboys is yet another example of arrogant coastal ignorance.

I am more sensitive to the argument that they only worked on the sheep operation that one summer. Afterwards Ennis worked with cattle and Jack worked most of his life in an office job (not as a """"rodeo cowboy"""" to whoever made that remark). However, the bulk of the movie painstakingly details that crucial first summer, the summer that so defined them. Therefore, I'd say that the relevant description, especially in this paragraph discussing THAT SUMMER, would be shepherds. That, however, is more up for debate. I would settle for calling them laborers who got jobs herding sheep. Although anybody who's ever worked on a ranch or knows a damn thing about ranching knows that that's just a circumlocution for shepherd. But since I don't want to make a personal hobby of constantly changing this page, I'll settle for that as a compromise. Chris

Endurance
Q: """"Thank you for the welcome and tips! I would like to move some of the stuff on the Endurance and the Expedition out of the Shackleton article, since their scope is really quite a bit larger than him - can I do this? Is there any special way? """"

A: Absolutely yes!  It's pretty easy....just pick a concise and appropriate name for a new article on the expedition and start to build new content there.  You get started by putting the new article title in the search box.  If it's available you'll get offered a link to start a new article with that name.

I suggest putting some comments on the discussion page of your new article describing what you are trying to accomplish (same thing goes for the Shackleton article).  That way, other editors won't misunderstand what's going on.   If the new article is going to be under construction for awhile, it's a good idea to put a """"stub"""" notice at the bottom of it so folks know that there is more to come.  You add a stub notice by putting this at the bottom of the page: {{stub}}

As the new article takes shape and adds breadth and depth that the parent article lacks, you may find you need to tinker with the parent article to ensure that there is the right amount of detail there...not too much and not too little.  

Lastly, you'll want to find out what other articles exist that should link to your new article and add links on them.  That requires a bit of searching and digging around but usually isn't a problem and helps integrate your article into the broader encyclopedia.

Good luck with your article!  If you need any help, don't hesitate to ask.

You claim in that diff that """"a policy which encourages editors to work together before deleting would hinder what editors who delete other editors hard work are trying to doing here"""": thanks for the blatant mischaracterization. I have worked together with many, many editors, and have achieved great results in doing so. I have also tried to upheld Wikipedia's policies in all cases, both when I deleted articles or nominated them for deletion, but also when I denied speedies, restored pages, or suggested to keep articles in AfD debates. Many of the AfD's I started were not """"other editor's hard work"""" but blatant hoaxes, copyright violations, and so on. Other's were about someone's hard work, which was just not suited for WIkipedia. We are not a free webhost, even though we have nearly unlimited space: we are an encyclopedia, and not everything is suited for inclusion. To decide what is and isn't suited, we have discussions, and I abide by the consensus if it follows our core policies (I have , if I recall correctly, never started a DRV when an AfD by me did not end in a delete, and I have also tried to incorporate the decision from one AfD in my next nominations).

From Parasaraprasna, Kapur Singh, Guru Nanak Dev University Press, Amritsar

 Thus those who see in the origin and contents of the Sikh
movement anything of this VaiSlJavism or the historical Bhakti
movement of the Middle ages, which was based on this VaiSDavism
or cognate propositions, show a complete lack of understanding ofthe
real nature of Sikhism. Beyond the fact that Sikhism is of historical
proximity to this Bhakti movement of the Middle ages, and that it
somewhat partakes of the atmosphere and temper of VaiSDavist
climate, it has not much in common with the latter. Among the
principal features of this climate are its anti-Brahmanical attitude, its
preference for vernaculars26 over Sanskrit, its total surrender theory,
such as Lokacarya's marjara27 doctrine, its stress on devotion through
image-worship rather than through knowledge, and its own peculiar
forms of ritualism, such as caste-marks.

It is easy to demonstrate that similarities of Sikhism with some of
these features are not so intimate or fundamental as to suggest any
direct or indirect borrowing.",0,0,0,0,0,0

I'm struggling to see what the current dispute is about after my enforced spell in the slammer.  Karbinski argues for """"Philosophy is the science that studies the fundamental aspects of the nature of existence in order to provide man with a comprehensive view of life. Major branches of Philosophy include Metaphysics, Epistemology, Ethics, Politics, and Aesthetics.

I prefer a return to the main four branches.  Deleting the 'reasoned argument' part is not supported by the sources, of which there are plenty.  Philosophy would be a science in the original meaning of 'science' (scientia) but the modern meaning, while not entirely different, has connotations that it would be best to avoid.  On whether the philosophy of language belongs in the main branches, that is debateable.  My view, given the dominance of the 'Old Logic' (the Categories and On Interpretation) and of the importance of those two to the Metaphysics, I would say it does belong.    """,0,0,0,0,0,0

While we appreciate your contributing to Wikipedia, there are certain things you must keep in mind about using information from your sources to avoid copyright or plagiarism issues here.

You can only copy/translate a small amount of a source, and you must mark what you take as a direct quotation with double quotation marks ("""") and a cited source. You can read about this at Wikipedia:Non-free content in the sections on """"text"""". See also Help:Referencing for beginners, for how to cite sources here.
Aside from limited quotation, you must put all information in your own words and structure, in proper paraphrase. Following the source's words too closely can create copyright problems, so it is not permitted here; see Wikipedia:Close paraphrasing.

By now I've written (or rewritten) most of the """"People's Park"""" article.  I was there from the beginning because Jon Read, my former employer, was the landscape architect responsible for the park's initial design.  He also provided the tools to build it and donated many of the materials. 

That first weekend was terrific!  I drove my truck (the one pictured in the """"Hippie: Travel"""" section) up to the site and parked it in the middle of the park as it developed around me.  My good friend David Garthwaite convinced his sister, Terry, that they should play music, so """"The Joy of Cooking"""" jammed all day. I cooked food for the crowd in my truck and worked laying sod.  Returned home at the end of the weekend, tired and happy.

When they fenced off the park, my truck was still parked in """"The Boneyard""""a place at 5th and Delaware in Berkeley where a number of people were building boats, vans and so on.  My neighbor, Alan Blanchard, had said goodbye to his wife, Sheila, and gone up to Telegraph Ave. to work at the Berkeley Reperatory Theater doing carpentry.  He heard some noise on the street, went up to the roof to see what was happening and was immediately hit by a volley of buckshot fired by an Alameda County Sheriff's deputy.  He never saw another thing, as he was permanently blinded.  James Rector, who was standing next to him, had seen the deputy point his shotgun at them; he turned and was running away when the blast hit him in the lower abdomen.  He died four days later.

I was in Sproul Plaza for Rector's memorial service just after he died.  The National Guard troops surrounded the plaza and pointed their bayonets inward, while helicoptors dropped CS gas directly on the thousands of people who had assembled.  Walking home after this gathering, we were assaulted by National Guard troops.  That night I defied the curfew and drove my truck all around Berkeleyno one was permitted on the streets after dark, and it was obviously a """"hippie truck""""yet they never stopped me, even at the roadblocks, which I ignored.

Yes, a whole other 60's saga.  Still makes me sad about Alanhis wife left him, and whenever I saw him after that he commented that he realized he would always remember me as he saw me on the last day he was sighted. """,0,0,0,0,0,0

The immediately afterwards mention responses to those criticisms.    Then go onto the next, and so on.  What seems most important to me is how neutrally the prose goes from one to the next.

Hi - I see you have recently created one or more new stub types. As it states at Wikipedia:Stub, at the top of most stub categories, and in many other places on Wikipedia, it is recommended that new stub types are proposed prior to creation at Wikipedia:WikiProject Stub sorting/Proposals, in order to check whether the new stub type is already covered by existing stub types, whether it is named according to stub naming guidelines, whether it is otherwise correctly formatted, whether it reaches the standard threshold for creation of a new stub type, and whether it crosses existing stub type hierarchies.

Obviously I disagree with the note about the photographs. The term """"graphic"""" tends to inappropriately stigmatize the nature of the photography. The photographas, are clinical and medical in nature. They are scientifically relevant and in no way should be associated with things like pornography or """"grpahic"""" sexuality that somme cultures consider inappropriate for some audience. Noting that they are Surgical photos makes their content emphatically clear for anyone who might not be emotionally or psychologically mature enough to view them. There are plenty of articles on wikipedia about medical issues, with photographs, that do not include any such warnings, e.g.:

 Breast_implant/Risks_and_debate

 Breast_implant

If you took the time to read the entirety of the information Anne Lawrence, MD provides on Dr. Metlzer's work and techniques, you will see that his origination of his techhniques and procedures are documented there. See also the referenced article by Takta, LL and Meltzer, TR, in pubmed. I believe this article is being held to a ridiculous and unfair standard, that is not representative of the wikipedia. I believe that the microscopic treatment this article has received is evidence of bias against its subject matter, while the simple fact is clear that this surgeon is referenced repeatedly in other wikipedia articles about related surgical topics. In  addition, the very nature of the subject matter should be protected a topic given the level of bigotry, discrimination, and violence including murder against people who receive these medical treatments. The very fact that a surgeon like Toby Meltzer, with such a prestigious medical background, chooses to concentrate on such service to other people, who have few if any equally qualified alternatives, is notable by itself, without need for any further citation. These surgeries are in and of themselves pioneering, and largely non-existent on any measurable scale before the 1960s. Even now, the number of frequent U.S. practitioners is few, including only Meltzer and Marci Bowers, MD (who was previously a patient of Meltzer!), on a truly regular basis.  19:29, 17 September 2006.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

Notice to vandalizing halfwits, linkspammers, and people who don't read WP:NOT

Before you sit down and construct a series of vandalizations to this page, or whine about the article I put a CSD tag on, or my AfD vote, you should be informed that your world orbits a ball of fire. This ball of deadly heat is paradoxically far enough away that it actually provides some level of benefit to those who spend a measured amount of time in front of it. While you should not in any way stare at it, a respectful glance in its direction will show you that it is warm and in some ways healthy. 

Accompanying the ball of fire is a collection of variant photosensitive lifeforms and constantly recycled breathing material, suitable for your use at any time you so please, and containing life-giving elements. As an added bonus, most of these materials are available to you entirely for free and 24 hours a day. 

We encourage you to cease vandalizing or whining on this page and get to know the magic ball of fire.

You may also ignore the fiery ball, if you so please, however I warn you that without it, you would never have been permitted to enjoy linkspamming or halfwittedness or ignorance of WP:NOT.

WP:SYNTH
An RfC was just closed at Talk:Climate change denial#RfC: Must the word 'denial; occur in every citation for climate change denial?, and it is interesting to read the closing statement there, in that it reflects community consensus about some aspects of when to use or not use sources about a topic without violating WP:SYNTH.   
The concluding statement says the term """"climate change denial"""" may be used if the source """"implicitly states they fall into the general group.""""  It has no relevance to anything discussed here.  It certainly is not a loophole for """"synthesis"""".    
I don't think anyone is looking for """"loopholes"""". I'm not arguing for any kind of slavish devotion to that discussion here, just for editors to take a look, and to think about it with an open mind. I think that the closing statement makes some good points about common sense.   
There is nothing """"slavish"""" about the devotion.  If most sources say the motivation of the terrorism is secular, then we cannot say it is religious and call it Christian terrorism.    
 I was saying that we don't have to follow that other page slavishly. And that other page isn't talking about situations where most sources say something is unrelated. If you are interested in what it does say, then you can read it. If you don't want to read it, then don't. Everything here does not have to be a WP:Battleground.   
As I have noted before, unless reliable sources attribute some religious motivation or aim,  I would not say Wikipedia should attribute such a motivation or aim.  If the sources ascribe motivation to irredentism, economic or other attribute and do not ascribe a religious aim, then it does not belong here.  Note the discussion just closed at Climate*.*  where the result was basically """"no consensus at all"""".  Cheers.   
Not sure what you mean, but I linked to a discussion where the closer said there was a consensus. I'm not going beyond what the closing statement said there.   
The issue has come up in articles about terrorism and about ideology.  Different writers may use different terms to mean the same thing or the same terms to mean different things.  Generally, in peer-reviewed literature, the terms used are defined and we can say that one author who defines """"Christian terrorism"""" as terrorism motivated by Christian belief and another who uses the term """"Christian religious terrorism"""" with the same definition are referring to the same thing.  However, another author who uses the expression """"Christian terrorism"""" and defines it as ethnic terrorism where religion is part of ethnic identity means the same thing as authors writing about """"religious communal terrorism"""" carried out by Christians, or """"nationalist terrorism"""" between different religious groups.
Can you provide a single source that should be included based on the opinion expresses in the climate change denial RfC?
  
I'm so tempted to just reply """"yes"""". And I really would rather not get into a wall-of-text over things that we will soon be discussing at the mediation. But let me try to clarify why I linked to that discussion. This isn't about definitions of """"Christian terrorism"""" in my view. It's about what the closing statement there said, that just because a particular word is not used explicitly in a source, does not mean that the source does not apply to a page – editors can use common sense to examine the context within the source. Thinking back to the discussions about the Lebanon section (now made somewhat moot by the Schbley source, that examines in detail the Maronite Monks), there was discussion of whether it was SYNTH to consider a United Nations source, because it used the word """"genocide"""" instead of the word """"terrorism"""". I'm pointing out that there is now some precedent for using common sense in evaluating the language of such sources, in context. If you or another editor sees common sense in that instance as indicating that genocide is not terrorism, that's still a discussion we can have. So that's why I provided that link. I'm not about to rewrite the Lebanon section on t",0,0,0,0,0,0

Are you being facetious? if not, you would have relayed the same message to Jza and MRSC as my words were no more stern than theres. If you would like evidence for any of the claims made on the talk, then I will only be too glad to provide. You also failed to provide diffs in your message to me, in regards to which words you're claiming are offesive, perhaps WP:Assume good faith.

The two users constantly harass and follow me to articles making disruptive edits in violation of numerous Wikipedia guidelines (WP:HARASS is just one). For example the removal of third party references from articles which don't suit their POV, without entering an edit summary (considered by Wikipedia guidelines as bad faith and a violation of WP:BLANK). The violation of WP:NEO by adding derogatory neologisms to the articles of organisations who they do not personally agree with, despite being made aware of the policy, despite not having any reference to the said organisation being described with said neologislm and despite the community majority constantly removing the derogatory term.  The same """"tag team"""" practise can be shown to be used against numerous other editors who edit articles on British culture and trad counties, not just against me. Again, if you would like evidence just ask.

It would seem however, looking at the messages on your talkpage above, especially the lovely intertude under """"UK mediation"""" section, that Jza messaged you (somebody he seems very familiar with) in violation of WP:CANVAS. Specifically the section on Wikipedia:CANVAS#Campaigning may interest you.

 Re:CUplex 

Hello Tungilik!

Unfortunately, you cannot, even tough you work and have access information at the City of North Battleford because no original research says """"original research used on Wikipedia to refer to material—such as facts, allegations, and ideas—for which no reliable, published sources exist"""" which means if an article has no sources it cannot be notable and hence counted as original research per General notability guideline.

Make sure that your sources must be reliable, if you want to know if a source is reliable. WP:SOURCE says """"a source material must have been published, the definition of which for our purposes is made available to the public in some form. Unpublished materials are not considered reliable"""" You can use university-level textbooks, books published by respected publishing houses, magazines, journals and mainstream newspapers as reliable sources. Never use blogs as sources as WP:NEWSBLOG says """"Never use blog posts that are left by readers as sources. For personal or group blogs that are not reliable sources.""""

Wikipedia strongly prefer """"free"""" files, wherever possible. When no """"free"""" file exist, it sometimes to ask a permission to use a non-free (copyright-protected) file under the """"fair use"""" provision. Ideally, most free files should be uploaded to Wikimedia Commons instead of Wikipedia. 

In uploading images, only logged in users with autoconfirmed accounts are allowed to upload images. Now, you first find out whether the image is legal in the United States (where the Wikipedia servers are located) also, if the image has not been released (to your knowledge) under a license, and is still under copyright you must gain permission to use the image from the copyright holder. Next if you're finish, determine which image copyright tag is applicable for your file.

In the procedure of uploading it, You can upload an image by using the Upload file link on the left side of the main page under Toolbox. Use good filenames because some filenames (such as highly generic filenames produced automatically by digital cameras) are disallowed, and attempting to use them will generate an error message.

Example of good file names:
 """":Image:City of London skyline from London City Hall - Oct 2008.jpg""""
 """"Sir John Betjeman (1906-1984).jpg""""

Example of bad file names:
 """"Image01.png""""
 """"DSC00001.JPG""""

I hope this helps in improving your article, I know it is a little bit complicated but you can ask questions at the Teahouse with more experienced editors in the wiki. Good luck!   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Removing """"Perhaps best known""""  from Judah Friedlander‎ 

Hello,

The issue isn't that a person is best known for something, as long as a WP:RS can be located, it's the formulation """"Perhaps best known"""" which seems to be widely used as a way of avoiding finding a RS for something the editor wishes to say.

Taekkyeon is a sensitive topic because many people want to learn it and not enough qualified teachers to disperse the knowledge. If you truly desire to learn Taekkyeon there are only two masters in the world who know the complete system. One is in S. Korea, he doesn't teach many people. The other lives in Los Angeles, CA. The truth is, you have to either move to Los Angeles or S. Korea if you want to learn the Taekkyeon as taught by GM Song and Im Ho. 
I will tell you this. GM Song was a bodyguard of the remaining Choson Dynasty family memebers. The top Taekkyeon masters always defended the king, They were in the military. Taekkyeon was a military artform first and a civil cultural game for children and adults later. By calling Taekkyeon a civil martial art game is demoting it from its real status.

""""Outline"""" is short for """"hierarchical outline"""". There are two types of outlines: sentence outlines (like those you made in school to plan a paper), and topic outlines (like the topical synopses that professors hand out at the beginning of a college course). Outlines on Wikipedia are primarily topic outlines that serve 2 main purposes: they provide taxonomical classification of subjects showing what topics belong to a subject and how they are related to each other (via their placement in the tree structure), and as subject-based tables of contents linked to topics in the encyclopedia.

Parts of my own Talk Page deleted by editors who think they know better

Dear impartial but not disinteresed reader, Coren and I have been having an entertaining and enjoyable """"discussion"""" on the finer points of """"soapboxing"""".  She is of the firm, resolute belief that this version of my own talk page amounts to """"soapboxing"""" and has deleted it.  I recognize that there may be elements of soapboxing in the """"investment predictions for 2008"""" section at the bottom of the page, but have given her the opportunity to amend rather than delete the whole section.  She has declined the opportunity to amend, leaving me in the difficult position of having to type this with a knife pressed ever-so-gently against my back, with Coren carefully looking over my shoulder at the screen to check whether anything is, in her God-like view, """"soap-like"""".  Not the most pleasant position to be in, I can assure you.

To use another example, picked completely at random: Let's say there's been a nasty and vicious and ugly and persistent edit war over, say, fractional reserve banking, and a number of editors want a messy but more informative version like this one kept in.  Then let's say I post this earlier version on my talk page for readers to compare with the now in-my-humble-view slaughtered version.  Is that """"soapboxing""""??

To use another example, closer to home.  Let's say a guy like Zenwhat says to his co-conspirators, """"What can we do to have OUR version of debt-based monetary system/fractional reserve banking prevail?"""", like he clearly said here under the (desperate?) heading """"Heeeeelp"""".  

And then he also (bizarrely?) asks Gregalton help him delete references to Mises.org like he did here, saying to Gregalton: """"Also, in case you're interested, one of the easiest ways to find economics articles that have been vandalized is to do a search for links to Mises.org""""

As if a reference to the great Ludwig von Mises amounted to VANDALISM? Can you BELIEVE IT?  I have to hold a pencil between my teeth just to keep control of myself and keep typing this.  The guy is clearly a vicious tiny weeny little troll.  

He also says to his co-conspirator the following, on the same page: 

""""I looked at the fractional reserve banking article recently and saw how it was so horribly vandalized. It made me realize that we're going around in circles. We improve the articles to the point that they look great. Then they get screwed up again. So, I had an idea: Would you be interested in helping me write an essay on """"Monetary Crankery""""? It could help people who AREN'T educated...The idea is for it to be straightforward, with references, but polemic and satirical of monetary crankery.""""

Clearly this guy is obsessed with deleting or """"satirizing"""" any positions on monetary theory that don't agree with his.  (The guy is mad.  If the guy had napalm or nukes he'd use them without hesitation.)   

Then, for good measure, he goes back to debt-based monetary system to do more """"editing"""".  

Zenwhat is clearly a piece of work.  Check out the dude's talk page.  In addition to his obsessive interest in deleting anything associated with Mises.org, his main interests appear to be something called """"cannabis culture"""" and """"the Buddhist connection with marijuana"""".  So, I gather from this that his main """"interests"""" are monetary theory and dope smoking.  What a combo!

Seeing this, I ponder my options.  I decide to post a note here, ON MY OWN TALK PAGE, asking readers to compare older (better?) versions of some important articles on monetary theory with the current versions.  For good measure I offer my predictions on the financial markets for 2008 as a gift to the (eight?) people persistent enough to read my humble little talk page.  

It immediately gets deleted by all-seeing, all-knowing Coren as """"soapboxing"""".  Is this strict compliance with WP guidelines or a WP-style Fascist Dictatorship where people like Coren delete at will, but don't bother to make CONSTRUCTIVE suggestions as to how what I have written CAN come within the guidelines?    

This is like watching evolution in reverse.  I carefully construct a page with the help of others.

The publication """"The Chamcha Age"""" - An Era of Stooges, written by Kanshi Ram is not copyrighted unless someone seems to have copyrighted it after his death. Kanshi Ram was editor of a publication """"The Oppressed Indian"""", issues of which of the late 70s and early 80s, I have read. I have also had the opportunity to witness him addressing gatherings on quite a few occasions. I felt that the content at the moment is drawn mostly from media reports that don't objectively represent this individual and his struggle for the emancipation of the downtrodden masses in India. Therefore, it should be okay to retain the first paragraph that is compiled from text on """"About the Author"""" from """"The Chamcha Age"""". At present, in web space, bspindia.org appears to be close in terms of being authentic in representing the views of the Bahujan Samaj Party, a political party founded by Kanshi Ram. Although this site claims copyright over the contents, it doesn't formally acknowledge the source from which it has drawn content that is available without copyright. I wouldn't mind writing to the webmaster@bspindia.org to get permission for use of content on their site for reproduction on wikipedia. 

Secondly, I can modify the article appropriately so that content from bspindia.org and other sources is only used as a source of 'information' instead of 'article content'.

 Seth Material 

Oasis, thank you for the supportive comments that you made on the Seth Material talk page recently.

If you are truly a new editor, there are some things you need to know.  Wikipedia's rules governing editing and the behavior of editors are very poorly written.  They encourage people who have nothing else to do to spend hours and hours on the site each day.  However, once an editor has exhausted his knowledge, any contributions he makes after that are of dubious value.  The result is that there are contingents of what I call """"Wiki-addicts"""" who make little positive contribution to the encyclopedia, but who make a lot of trouble for other editors.  They generally call themselves """"skeptics"""", and they spend hours each day attacking articles they don't like.  They fancy themselves to be guardians of neutrality, but their edits are rarely neutral.  They also fancy themselves to be Wikipedia experts, and consequently they are rarely willing to collaborate.  Generally, they are atheists, right-wing Christians and political conservatives, and they attack articles on topics that are not in the mainstream, especially in the area of religion.  The Seth Material article has suffered from such attacks since it was created a couple years ago.  Recently, several """"skeptics"""" ganged up on me and got me kicked off the article.  The editors who are now in control of it have no knowledge of the Seth Material whatsoever, beyond the fact that they don't like it, so the article is now controlled by editors who would prefer to delete the article altogether.  They have already cut out portions of it.  If you want to see the most complete version of the article, look for the version edited by """"Itsmejudith"""".  You'll find text in there that has since been deleted.

Basically, my message to you is that Wikipedia is a hostile environment, especially if you are interested in topics of religion or spirituality.  If you have things to say in those areas, it is best to do it on your own web site.  With so many editors on Wikipedia intent on censoring information they don't like, it is very hard to make contributions in those areas without getting into non-stop edit-wars.  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Kitzinger 

Regards reference 46, Framing abuse by Kitzinger, I got the book out of the library yesterday.  In the index, and on a brief flip through there is no mention of satan, satanic abuse, ritual abuse, the United States, religion, religious leaders, the satanic panic, courts, judicial systems, guilt, or anything else that really supports the sentence """"In America and Britain journalists framed the charges against the defendants as evidence of a moral panic and mass hysteria; child protection workers and social workers involved were bound by their professional codes of confidentiality and unable to comment on the specifics of the cases""""  There is focus on two cases - Cleveland and Orkney, both in the UK.  Based on my reading, the main focus of the book is on how the media's portrayal of the cases affected the public's perception of the event years later - not on guilt or innocence (though there is discussion on how the media left out and selectively reported details that were more convincing of the guilt of the parents.  If anyone on this talk page has read the book or is responsible for placing the text on the page, could you refer me to the page number (and chapter in case we have different versions) so I can verify?  Right now I'm tempted to excise the statement for having a) nothing to do with the U.S. b) nothing to do with the outcome of court cases and c) nothing to do with satanic ritual abuse.  If nothing else, it would allow the most nuanced, hopefully most neutral, portrayal of the book's contents.  Kitzinger appears to be very carefully saying nothing about the suspects' guilt or innocence, but I admit it is a cursory flip-through.  Got some other scholarly books from the same section in the library, some of which discuss SRA specifically, hopefully I'll find time to read them.    """,0,0,0,0,0,0

The Liberal Democrats do not have a hope in NW Hants even if they have a good candidate. In this constituency unemployment is very low, and home ownership is high, all of which helps Labour and the Conservatives who were the top two parties in the constituency in 2001, both exhibiting positive swings while the Lib Dems lost votes. This is an obvious Tory hold. Nevertheless, good luck Mr Tod. Maybe you'll get to fight for a different constituency in 2010, but by that time the Lib Dems will probably have changed their views on almost everything anyway.

 Israeli-Palestinian conflict protect? 

Yesterday there were relevent and reliably-sourced casualty figures added to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict article, and some editors objected to this. It seems you were called in to quickly """"protect"""" the page from editing, effectively blocking the inclusion of the figures. You cited """"edit warring,"""" the more accurate term would be repeated reverts from those who did not like the figures for political reasons. There are casualty figures in all the conflict, war, battle etc. Wiki articles I have referenced, why not this one? Thanks   
RomaC, the edits which you tried to make were a set of statistics for one year only, which you attemepted to place in the first paragraph of an article describing a conflict of over sixty years. This article covers an issue of extreme sensitivity and complexity. The fact that your edits sparked so much conflict and opposition speaks for itself. Here at Wikipedia, we value the ability to achieve consensus, and to be fair to many viewpoints. And believe it or not, we often do achieve that at the article Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It is not enough to disinegnuously claim that your figures were """"reliable,"""" without addressing any of the underlying issues, or any of the conflicts which it clearly and immediately caused. 

To repeat: statistics for just one year of the conflict do not belong anywhere in the article's lead. there are a wide variety of figures which either side could quote, all in the name of objectivity, which would clear and unacceptably attempt to create a slant towards one side or the other. please note, this is why we are careful when making edit to be sure that we actually have consensus, rather than simply telling others that they should provide consensus.   

I strongly object to your calling me """"disinegnuous"""" [sic]. You wrote on the article talk page that you agreed with Hertz1888, who argued that the statistics might be biased. Do you not regard Haaretz as a reliable source? Please explain more clearly why you feel that citing reliably-sourced and up-to-date civilian casualty statistics in an article about a war, battle or conflict is disingenuous. If you or any other editor want to add more statistics, covering a longer time period, then go ahead, but do not delete relevant content added by other editors. Yes, the edit """"sparked so much conflict and opposition"""" but note also also that here at Wikipedia we do not determine what is """"fair"""" through intimidation by numbers. There is a big difference between consensus and false compromise.   

I apologize if you felt I was offending you in any way. i only meant to describe the appearance of your edits, not to describe you personally in any way. if other editors deleted some edits, it is because they genuinely felt there was a reason to do so, and that the material was not beneficial or fair to the article. I responded to your concerns and issues further at the article talk page. thanks.    

Apology accepted, and I will also make my further comments on the article talk page. I am not a single-issue editor I get around a bit on Wiki, saw the Haaretz report and very much believe it is something very relevant to the article. I can't say I know for certain why other editors deleted the material, I try to assume good faith, we'll see.   
""""repeated reverts from those who did not like the figures for political reasons"""" - motive doesn't really matter, its still edit warring, its still disruptive. Protection is not an endorsement of the current version. Z-man 
The subject of this article is a deadly conflict, the lede is huge - and yet it contains no mention of the casualties. Clearly, there is something seriously wrong. As a result, your action here, while well-intentioned, looks highly partisan. Worse than that, it looks rather like like a cynical move to protect deniers, those who wish to cover up atrocities, the mass killings of (mostly) unarmed civilians, in many cases recognised by Western sources as war-crimes. If the events at this article really offend you, it would be a lot better to lock it at the alternative version. talk 10:39,",0,0,0,0,0,0

If you allow Serbs and others to ruin Wiki's reputation and allow characters like Miquonranger03 to edit and post lies and hate on wiki, Wiki will open itself to all kinds of problems, legal and all kinds, EU laws are quite clear about hate speech, I am sure you also disapprove of hateful propaganda on wiki. Please act now and ban  Miquonranger03 and remove offending material, only when transcripts of this document are available should this be posted, with highlighted parts of the transcripts, nothing less would do, btw plz read the quteded article, it is all made up lies and hate speech by Miquonranger03. 

thank you.

    * As for border posts, when border posts are disarmed, then they will be disarmed, all of them, as many as there are, but leave Albanians five bullets in their automatic rifles, and the rest locked up in cellars and given food and water if this goes on for a few days. As for this, if something happens, then just give instructions to all your people who you know. Kill extremists on the spot, in the street, in the compound, in barracks, anywhere. Just pistol and into the stomach. That will not be a war, it will be a civil war in which there is no mercy towards anyone, women or children, that doesn't concern us. Into homes, family homes, quite simply grenades. (Špegelj)

    * We are going to resort to all resources. We're even going to use weapons. Knin we're going to resolve in the same way. We are going to slaughter everyone. We have international recognition for that that we're going to slaughter them now that this whore won in Serbia.

    * We are going to use all resources. We're going to use weapons as well. Serbs in Croatia will never be there again for as long as we are there and we hope until now too their supremacy is a thing of the past. Their Knin will never be Knin again. We are going to enter Knin too. Knin has to disappear as Knin. All Croats should bear this in mind and we are going to create a state created at all costs, if necessary, at the cost of shedding blood. (Boljkovac)

 Encore a mistake in interpretation  

Mr Shyamal, 

You made a serious mistake in interpretation, which seems normal for those who are not specialists in entomology and taxonomy in the dipterous ones.  But, please show me once again that I make an attack with the person of Rognes, because I must explain you where you did not understand.  

In your correct information for the articles of your Wikipedia, you must read and analyze all the bibliographical data and to understand well the problems of a taxon or a group of let us taxa.  Thus, you can note that Rognes is the only amateur faunist (and not a recognized specialist), who wishes to make """" revolutions """" in taxonomy, without knowing Bengaliidae, without knowing the morphology of dipterous (in general), without being able to make a correct identification according to the male genitalia even of usual Calliphoridae.  In more he wanted to introduce an aberrant and specific terminology for his pupils of the school of handicappers of Stavanger (Norway) where he works, and was unaware of always the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature.  All its """" research """" is not recognized by the community of the specialists.  Only his friends of the same structure, namely:  Thomas Pape (the recognized intellectual robber and the most stupid taxonomist nowadays), C Thompson, N.L. Evenhuis, J.E. O' Hara and (unfortunately) A. C. Pont wrote a bibliographical work, nonscientific, in which they mentioned exactly what I have says to you before on Rognes.  He cannot identify any species of Bengaliidae and he does not have competence to establish that Bengalia testacea  is the species-type of the Bengalia kind.  This false type was mentioned before by Sabrosky in a stupid work of bibliography (nonscientific), in collaboration with the same ignoramuses collaborators (1999:62).  You must know exactly that of Zumpt until Lehrer, the species-type of the Bengalia kind is Bengalia labiata R.D. - not B testacea sensu Duponchel 1842 & Rognes, which is a nomen nudum. 

Thus, for the exactitude of your encyclopaedic information you must change distort them given.  Moreover, I give you the council of reading certain articles documented by Lehrer in Fragmenta Dipterologica:  2010, 23: 1-`22 and 22-25;  24:16-20 and 20-23;  26:  21-30 [ [ http://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Z._Lehrer ] ] and the work: LEHRER& WEI, 2010, Un nouveau genre oriental de la famille Bengaliidae (Diptera), Bull.

 Advice 

I apologize for your recent difficulties, your block was clearly undeserved. Our governance here at Wikipedia is imperfect and too often administrators abuse the power we grant them. While we can’t prevent it we can work around it - in this case by creating a new identity to bypass your block - what we call a """"sockpuppet"""" account. Officially it’s frowned upon but so long as it’s undetected a sockpuppet is just as functional as a regular account. In fact many current and former administrators are sockpuppet accounts. The instructions below provide an easy guide to creating your new account and avoiding detection.

Instructions
 Log out of your Wikipedia account, clear your cookies (google """"how to clear all cookies"""" for instructions) and close your browser
 Download a new browser: Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer. This will be your dedicated Wikipedia browser
 Follow these instructions to permanently disable javascript in your new browser: Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer
 And these to permanently disable java: All browsers
 Reset your IP address. With most  ISPs the procedure is as follows: unplug your modem, wait 10 minutes, plug it back in. Use this website (http://www.whatsmyip.org/) to check your IP address before and after to verify it's changed. If it has, great, if not you may have to wait a few hours or a few days before repeating this procedure successfully
 Now you're ready to register your new Wikipedia account

Tips
 Never log into your old account from the same network or with the same browser as your new account
 Don't choose an account name similar to your old account name; administrators will use that as an excuse to sanction you
 Don't edit your user page or your talk page straight away; it's a dead giveaway you’re not a new user. Remember, this user is “new” to Wikipedia
 Mess up a little - forget to sign or sign incorrectly, split someone's comment “accidentally” - everything to give the impression this is your first experience editing Wikipedia
 Avoid noticeboards and contentious articles until you’ve made a reasonable number of edits; sockpuppet or not experienced Wikipedians don't appreciate being held to community standards by new users

All done. Happy editing and welcome back. I hope your new experience will be more pleasant.    — John Whales, Founder and CEO of the World Wide Web

a7e7ba1c3deea3e0,"(Sub)Tropical Storm - May 27-28, 1988? 

Check it out. I was trying to find an image for Tropical Depression One in 1988, when I came across this, which looks like a well-organized unclassified storm just off of North Carolina. On May 26 a cold front extended across the western Atlantic Ocean. The next day, a circulation developed to the southeast of Charleston, South Carolina, with much of its convection sheared to the northeast; at the time, it might have still been frontal. Tracking to the northeast, by early the next day the center became more involved with the convection, though only based on interpolation from IR. By the time of the first visible image, it was just off of the Outer Banks of North Carolina, possibly extratropical or subtropical, based on the (presumably) cold air being entrained. Convection deepened, and three hours later it looked tropical, which is where I found the image. Unfortunately, there's no more Atlantic visible images after that due to an error. Nilfanion found this visible satellite image, meaning it must not have been very deep. Here's another, and here's a small one. Verdict? Probably an extratropical cyclone and maybe a subtropical cyclone that had some aspirations to do something.  (talk)",0,0,0,0,0,0

CC vs RCC

""""The points you make, replete with the claims of injustice and oppression (despite the fact that there are several Roman Catholic editors who support the current name or don't care about the issue one way or the other) have all been made before, as Archive 7 above will reveal in all its prolix glory.  I invite you to read it if, for nothing else, the strange sense of deja vu it will likely inspire in you, as it does in me. Cheers."""" 

This it the type of patronizing rhetoric I've received from what I consider at this point, outwardly Anti-Catholic editors in this site.  I know there is a good faith policy, sure, but the repeated disrespect and blatantly forward condescending attitude is just too obvious to conclude anything less.  

I am aware you have supported the change of the article for the proper name """"Catholic Church"""" in the past.  I am determined to have our voice heard again and have this issue reviewed and hopefully repealed.  However, there is no way I can do this myself, I need you help and anyone else that may assist us.  (by the way where the due process ?)

My most significant points for change are found in the one of my latest post as follows:

 """"1)Using a geographic description in addition to the title of a Church has to be one of the poorest excuses. What is not understood is that regardless of additional descriptive properties """"Catholic"""" Church IS the common title of the Petrine Church in the equivalent manner as """"Anglican"""" Church is the common title of the Church of England...regardless of any descriptive meanings of the words """"Catholic or Anglican"""". If anything it proves how inappropriate it is to impose an extrinsic adjective upon an institution that is not titled in such a manner. If that is allowed then where does it end. Why not add to the Greek the Athenian Orthodox Church, or say London Anglican Church since the symbolic head of the Anglican communion resides there.

2)Since """"Catholic Church"""" is NOT a description, but the title of the lone Church titled as such, by far, historically, in the present and by the world at large it deserves to be title as such. It is not ambiguous, Anglicans do not say they are going to the Catholic Church, do they? Thus, no point in pulling out the ambiguity alibi Also, the article describes one Church, it is not a comparative study of several churches, no confusion to be entertained.

3)The personal ignorance of a Catholic which refers to himself as Roman Catholic is not an excuse to go by such a term. Many of these same Catholics are the same ignorant Catholics that think Catholics of other rites are not real Catholics. Thus, ignorance is no reason, if any a reason for proper education.

4)The listing of a Parish as Roman Catholic is reference to the Rite not the Church at large(albeit slang, where """"Roman"""" is interchanged for """"Latin"""") just as Byzantine Catholic churches are frequently listed as Greek Catholic Church. Since this article is discussing the Church at large and not the Rite, the usage within the church by the """"listing"""" excuse does not apply to this article.

5)The Church in the few instances where it does add the descriptive adjective """"Roman"""" it is used in reference to its Petrine primacy and only when describing or comparing the Church with other schimatic churches.  This fact, is perfectly exemplified in Pope Pius XII's encylical Humani Generis where he mearly mentions """"Roman Catholic Church"""" as he speaks of churches not in  full communion. Because, in that entire encyclical Puis referrs to the Church as simply """"The Church"""" vs RCC 46 times to 1.

6)Since, this article is NOT from within the Church there is no way to confirm that it is not mentioned pejoratively, thus the additional push to disregard this disrespectful term.  Face it, the only way to prove an article's description is not meant pejoratively is only if it comes from within the Church. (Wikipedia should not pretend that anti-Catholicism does not exist)

Lastly,Wikipedia is not a Protestant or Anglican outlet. I mean really how many Protestants, Anglicans, or Orthodox refer to themselves as """"Catholic"""", yet that article is presented from the non-Catholic POV(as well as Catholicism). Yet, the Catholic is supposed to shut up and take it - fine, I'll take that for the terms """"Catholic and Catholicism"""". However, we are not allowed the common title of our Church in the name of outlandish excuses, instead the Catholic is supposed to swallow a term imposed by others outside the church, Anti-Catholicism, as is the preferred connotation of those against the Petrine Church.[9] [10] Where are the concessions coming from the non-Catholics?

The injustice is truly preposterous! """"

Hi, Oda Mari. Long time no see. I hope all is well with you and that you're having fun editing. I've stopped editing here and moved over to a Japanese film-specific wiki. (There are several reasons for my departure. The main one is that I believe, Wikipedia's """"notability"""" criteria makes all non-English, non-mainstream film articles easy targets for deletion, unless they have been extensively written about in English.) Unfortunately, so far, the editors only consist of a native English-speaker (myself), and (I believe) a native Czech-speaker. So, with no native Japanese-speaker, we sometimes have to wrestle with the Japanese language a bit ;-) A question has come up at:

Hi, I think that you are doing well with the GA review on the parathyroid gland. There are certain things about it that I would find difficult to describe quickly that makes me think that it is nudging GA status, but not quite there yet. Of course, the parathyroid glands and PTH are only part of a system that regulates Ca and PO4. Parathyroids have a thin capsule. According to my books, the sizes can be asymmetrical, so it would be better to say that a normal parathyroid gland is less than 60 g, than give the average weight. If you think that I could contribute something to the final phase of the GA over the next week or two, then I would appreciate it if you could check my grammar of anything that I added to the article.

This block is even more outrageous and illegitimate than the first. You didn't even allow me to say anything; that alone makes this charade illegitimate and unacceptable. The whole essence of Dougweller's argument over the last few weeks has been that article talk pages can and should be viewed in isolation when addressing a dispute. Bbb23 and JamesBWatson agreed with him in this regard and that was the main basis for punishing me for the recent conflict that was started by Mzilikazi1939. Therefore my actions of yesterday constitute complete compliance with the rules and the comments from these two administrators. As was made crystal clear on Talk:Aesop yesterday, Mzilikazi and his friends never complied with the rules set out in WP:ERA in their latest attempt to change the article Aesop. I already tried merely correcting their illegal actions and explaining it in edit summaries and personal talk pages but they continued ramming through their illegal changes, so yesterday, even though corrections of rule breaches should not require discussion, I made the peace-making effort of explaining the matter on the talk page Talk:Aesop.

I went above and beyond what was required in order to see a peaceful resolution to Mzilikazi's edit war and I fully complied with both the Wikipedia rules and the wishes of the two administrators who had judged on the issue. If I broke the rules by obeying those administrators then the first block was obviously not valid and therefore an indefinite block now is not allowed. In fact, any punishment now would not be allowed because the alleged rule breach was entirely due to the directions given by Bbb23 and JamesBWatson, i.e. that article talk pages, as asserted by Dougweller, are meant to be viewed in isolation from other talk pages. My peace-making efforts yesterday were most certainly not a """"diatribe""""; it was a clearly and thoughtfully written explanation of what the issue was, how Mzilikazi's actions breached the rules and even how to resolve the matter. Unlike what we've seen from Mzilikazi and Dougweller consistently, I included no personal attacks in my efforts of yesterday. Bb23 made the dubious accusation that I had used personal attacks in recent weeks but I reject that entirely; I never called anyone names and I never tried to rely on ad hominem arguments to """"justify"""" my position, unlike what we've seen from Mzilikazi in particular. Yesterday's edit was completely free from personal attacks; that's undisputable.

The very fact that Bbb23 would describe yesterday's tactful, eloquent, peace-making effort as """"diatribe"""", an extremely strong word, is more than enough proof that he has strong feelings about the issue and, as per WP:INVOLVED is therefore ineligible to participate in an administrative capacity here. This is a breach of the same policy that User:EncycloPetey broke when he banned me years ago, causing him to be stripped of his administrator status. I was already wondering how Bbb23 could block me the first time with that non-sensical, contradictory excuse for an explanation.

If article talk pages aren't meant to be viewed in isolation then both Aesop's Fables and Aesop are meant to be using the standard English style of dates. That is what I originally insisted but for that I was blocked by Bbb23. However, if, as asserted by Dougweller and agreed to in the rulings of Bbb23 and JamesBWatson, article talk pages are meant to be viewed in isolation then Aesop's Fables is a lost cause and Mzilikazi has got away with his change there but Aesop is still meant to remain in the BC/AD state. Yesterday's edit is in complete compliance with that ruling and I even made the additional effort of explaining it on the talk page to ensure that I could not be successfully accused of making trouble. For anyone who reads what I wrote at Talk:Aesop yesterday, there can be no doubt that not only did I comply with the rules yesterday, but I even went out of my way to work towards ending Mzilikazi's conflict peacefully and in accordance with the proper procedures.(  )""",0,0,0,0,0,0

8868ad2f05411ae0,"Bot tagging 

Greetings,
I have seen your name everywhere already. Thanks for your recent attention to WP:PHILO and the aesthetics dept. I had recently been working on the logic project. I did quite a bit of work on it, and then ran up against some cultural issues.

I wanted to get User:SatyrBot (an apparently wonderful service!!) to automatically tag articles with the new logic banner for the purpose of assessment. I put together a category list, publicized the issue, and then moved forward with no objection. Well the complainers came out of the woodwork! The bot was stopped and at this point most have been untagged. I find all of this quite terrible.

Since then, I have been working on WP:PHILO with all of these task forces. I got the sense that people were a lot less uptight in general over there. I have changed direction a bit and now am advocating that the philosophy project tag incorporate these fields and be placed appropriately, etc. However, there is no real enthusiasm for the auomatic bot tagging proposal. Although there is far less hostility to it!  

I intend to ask the bot to tag just the Aesthetics project and see how things go. I haven't put this proposal out to WP:PHILO yet, I wanted to give you a chance to comment on it. Any advice or support in these goals would be appreciated.",0,0,0,0,0,0

You will never get anywhere with the likes of Keepcalmandcarryon, Mastcell, Nunh-huh, etc. Going into the archives of some of the articles here on AIDS and HIV, I found that some of these people have been working, full-time it seems, on keeping these pages biased for years, and that they don't allow any edits which provide alternative information to the orthodox theory that HIV=AIDS, or anyone attached to these theories. They can be illogical, bullying, they will name-call, they will call any persons with honest questions denialists, and they will use any and every strategy no matter how ugly to keep these pages the way they want them to read. They don't allow edits they don't like to stay up for more than 30 minutes, and their tactic is to bully and threaten people until they give up. Of course people do give up, because they become exhausted and worn down as nothing they try to correct will stay up. Interestingly enough, some of these people also police pages on subjects such as Aspartame and alternative medicine. It's frightening how the AIDS orthodoxy doesn't want the public to know the facts. Most horrifying is the effect on AIDS patients themselves, who have the right to know everything there is to know and to make their own choices. I'd be interested to know your uncle's history, whether he was taking AIDS medications, what AIDS-related disease he actually died from, etc. AIDS has turned into a fear campaign - they give you a death sentence, and tell patients that if they stop the drugs that they will die.

Copra was a main crop in Samoa before German trade, it's stated so in your own version. Yet then later saying that it was monopolized by Germans. There weren't enough Germans to work a plantation, at most were soldiers. Samoa trade was involved, yet your version paints a white on brown invasion of interests.

Hi Were - I am markdask but can't login. My comp crashed recently and I had to fully reinstall. No biggie - except I was soo long logged into Wiki I forgot the password. So I simply requested a reset and anticipated the auto-email. It aint arrived - on two seperate occasions. If you can access my acc it should list my registered email as markdask@msn.com. So why aint I receiving wikimail? I can access my user page so can read any messages, though you might choose to refer me to a collegue.

Any assistance much appreciated

ffcdcb71854f6d8a,"""Editing of article without Consensus & Removal of Cited Content without Discussion===
I find it telling that neither of you had the courtesy to respond to my proposal and K3 went ahead to begin editing the article without any consensus being reached. Let the record note that I am now compelled to reciprocate your actions and make my suggested changes. JJ obviously lacks any serious knowledge in this area and was only here for circumventing 3RR, so there's no point answering his most recent underinformed questions. I'll focus on Kautilya3. If you were significantly acquainted with the topic, you would understand that the Kakatiyas were feudatories of the Eastern Chalukya dynasty.So the question of when the formal royal dynasty began is a natural question, not """"patent nonsense"""", and probably one of the reasons some previous editor changed the old date to """"Uncertain"""". 1053 was the date given for the first royal inscription based on the permanent grant of Hanumakonda (their original capital for your edification) as a fief to the Kakatiyas. I also suggest you both refresh your knowledge of WP:Civility, to improve the quality of your current and future discussions. If you don't know about an author, here's a hint, ask...politely..rather than first disrespectfully dismissing the author, then demanding his c.v. What's more, his book speaks for itself. Its the History and Culture of Andhra Pradesh (the old state which included the new state of Telangana). This is not some arcane ivory tower speculative paper, but a WP:RS. So if you want to change the date to 956CE, perfectly fine by me. The only difference is, I had the sense of responsibility to provide a citation. I suggest you do the same. 

Let me repeat that I am perfectly fine with having a respectful dialogue. But as I've said before, it takes two hands to clap. Ball is in your court, gentlemen.

Regarding passport control, the first part could perhaps read better as """"owing to the United Kingdom not being a par of the Schengen Area, it chooses to apply additional security controls, and at the point of entry"""".  I have on occasions encountered no passport controls at Brussels and instead had an on-train check, or controls at Waterloo, or both.  I have been at Brussels at busy time and seen them waving past people with Lille tickets (meaning you could complete an international journey without hitting passport control).
Regarding scanning, this is associated with the Channel Tunnel, and the intergovernmental commission requirement to scan 25% of passengers (which Eurostar fulfill by scanning 100% of passengers).  Metal detectors/X-ray machines are also used before boarding high-speed services in Spain.
Regarding local trains.  I suspect you have in mind the impact of the Oresund Railway.  However, Calais is a tiny town and there is very little demand for through traffic.  The Channel Tunnel (and Eurotunnel) impose additional technical requirements (fire protection, train length, redundancy) for transit.  The transit fees are very high and extra equipment is needed to match paragraph height, electrical supply, signalling and radio in the Tunnel.  (See Eurotunnel Network Statement 2008).

I've removed your first citation referencing RHINOSINUSITIS: Current Concepts in Evaluation and Management for obvious reasons: the article does not endorse pulsatile irrigation as an improved method of irrigation. Below is the only text which makes reference to pulsatile irrigation, but note that it does not promote it whatsoever:

""""Aside from antimicrobial therapy, there is little in the way of placebocontrolled
studies on other drugs commonly prescribed for the rhinosinusitis
patient.I5 It is generally agreed that maintenance of a moist intranasal environment
and the mobilization of inspissated mucus, particularly with impaired
mucociliary transport from infection (viral or bacterial), is beneficial in patients
with all forms of rhinosinusitis, and ample oral fluid intake should be encouraged.
Saline nasal sprays are inexpensive and provide moisture to the nasal
cavity, reduce dryness, and help to clear secretions. Nasal irrigations, via a pump
(e.g., Water Pik, Teledyne, Fort Collins, CO) and an appropriate diffusion spray
tip, may be performed twice a day when the patient is symptomatic; many use
such a nasal and sinus cleansing regimen for months after sinus surgery until
the nasal lining reepithelializes. In those with bacterial carrier states difficult to
eradicate with oral or intravenous antibiotics alone, such as the Klebsiella of
ozena or the Staphylococcus or Pseudomonas of cystic fibrosis, antibiotics can be
delivered directly to the mucosa and infected secretions by adding bacitracin
(250,000 units/1000 mL) or gentamicin (160 mg/1000 mL; some use tobramycin)
to the saline solution irrigations, delivered at 200 mL once or twice daily.""""

I just noticed that the page for Bard Of Ely was removed from Wikipedia. [] I feel that there should have been some sort of tag attached to the page before removal. I also am mystified by the reference of the dismissal of the the page due to your comment,(promotion written by a friend). I have found that indeed Bard Of Ely is a noteable artist, and should have remained in the Wikipedia listings. For instance, did you know, Bard Of Ely has an EP out on a proper label(Crai Records), and he worked with musicians such as Crum(ex-Hawkwind[], Phil Moxham (Young Marble Giants), Robin Williamson(Incredible String Band) and Gruff Rhys (Super Furry Animals)and having compered and played at Glastonbury Festival [] and the Green Man Festival [] as well as having been rave reviewed in the NME []. I suppose it's up to the wandering editors to make these decisions. But, how do you determine a friend wrote the info on Bards page ??? For instance, I do not know Bard Of Ely personally, and could be considered a professional associate of Bard. Does this mean I can write a page about Bard Of Ely and it won't be removed ???? Please clarify the standards by which you elected to remove Bards page other than it may have been written by a friend. ie; For instance, the content was not verified and credible. Also, please indicate what makes an article not to the standard of Wikipedia, when in fact the references made in the article are internal links that have a direct relavence to the encyclopedia itself. I'm not trying to cause a stir here, but, I find it strange that Bards page was ripped down, when in fact I have found a few other artists pages that have been left up, and do not contain the same concrete documentation as Bard Of Ely's did. If you would like me to point those out to you, all you have to do is ask !!!! Take care, and please understand, that I am trying to understand some of the standards you work under for deciding to remove pages of Wikipedia noteable musical artists.

It's great that you welcomed a user on User talk:Zoe molina, however, there were a couple of problems. I think that you probably used copy-and-paste, so, the links did not work, and the 'helpme' was actually on the page - the big 'I have a question' box was appearing.

Also, you added a non-free picture, and they cannot be used on user pages.

In future, the best thing to do is, use a 'welcome' template - you would put, for example. {{subst:welcome}} (and then sign with ~~~~. That will add a 'standard' welcome on their page, and all the links will work.

c4821a8136170420,"A few weeks ago, in anticipation of Millennium Park regaining its featured topic status, I broached the idea of CUP credit after the last article was promoted and you indicated that credit would not be granted.  It is my belief that I misrepresented the work done to regain Featured Topic status at a time when one last article was needed.  It is also my belief that you rendered a decision that getting credit for getting one last article promoted was gaming the system. You noted that this type of credit was dangerous territory for the cup.  Clearly, just having articles added to a topic or repromoting a deleted topic could be gaming the system, but when a rule change requires taking a 17-article topic from 1/3rd  to 1/2 Featured content, it is not a matter of gaming the system.

The winner of this contest could come down to whether you grant me Featured Topic points for Wikipedia:Featured topics/Millennium Park. I earned FT points for this topic when it was first promoted.  At that time the topic was 15 articles and the requirement was that 1/3 of the articles be WP:FC and all be at least WP:GA.  Thus, I was acknowledged for bringing 5 of 15 topics to featured status.  However, during the year two articles (Park Grill and Grant Park Music Festival) were added to the topic and the requirement was increased to 1/2 of the articles needing to be featured. Thus, I had to ensure that the two new articles be promoted to good article (which I did without a lapse in topic status) and that a total of 9 of the 17 articles reached featured.  Thus, I helped raise McCormick Tribune Plaza & Ice Rink (March 23), Harris Theater (Chicago) (June 12), Millennium Park (August 31) and Exelon Pavilions (September 25) to featured.

 In response to Claude's last two posts.  Backwards of course.  Regarding NRMs - if you'll check the list, you'll see that Assemblies of God, Calvary Chapel, Foursquare, and CMA are all considered both NRMs and denominations.  Just a note.  Also true of the Vineyard Movement, of which there are many comparisons to GCA.  You're right that GCC doesn't like the denominational nametag,   but just like Vineyard many outsiders consider it to be and there is little actual semantic difference.  As far as what a movement is, a couple definitions I found were """"a diffusely organized or heterogeneous group of people or organizations tending toward or favoring a generalized common goal: the antislavery movement; the realistic movement in art."""" and """"An organized effort by supporters of a common goal: a leader of the labor movement.""""
 I say all that to say this.  Movement is a very ambiguous term, more appropriate to an idea.  You're right that GC does use the term frequently.  However, I think the best factual definition, and most suitable for our purposes and for accuracy within the title and intro, is """"GCAC is an association of churches"""".  That's what the AC in GCAC stands for.  Really, that's what we actually see in existence - churches.  Somehow we need to differentiate - I think we need to start with definiing the article as about an association of churches, because we have to pick a topic - that is one thing plaguing us at present as editors.  So let's start with something real, then trace the history of that association. and the present.
 I will re-edit the Today section.  It is not NPOV at present.  What I objected to was not the quote but rather your original sentence before it.  I was confused about the date, couldn't find it in your reference (I was in a hurry).  We need to focus on what we're doing here - we're putting facts up.  We don't need to interpret or extrapolate.  That quote from Bovenmeyer seems to be about  church leadership, with one sentence relating that to autonomy.  For that reason, while I think it should stay, it would be wrong to put that forth as the best description of the GC view of autonomy and congregational polity since neither of those is the topic.      Again, your statement isn't found in the quote.  The quote itself is fine, and appropriate - i don't see any reason that it needs a qualifier - as the quote i put above from the cong. polity article says, leadership/authority is a common integral part of cong. polity, and as we all have said there is no """"typical view"""" - if we're going to have cong. polity as a term in the GCA article, people need to go there and read it (also someone needs to put some serious work in on that article).  I don't have any problem with  deferring to leaders - i just want accuracy here.  Also note that there is a difference between an article in an official publication by one man and an official stance of the org (which is listed in several places), especially given the independence and autonomy of the churches within GCA.

But you're predicating the above on a false assumption, one I said was one of the things you're accusing me of: that fact is I have dealt with the issues Jdchamp raised, and done so in the proper forums, and intend to continue if I ever see a constructive argument come his way. The only extent to which I haven't has been me trying to do exactly the same """"Step back and take a deep breath"""" since Monday thing that you're now arguing I should do. I honestly started to wonder if this was my imagination, so I just checked, I've even had a healthy discussion on the """"poll"""" area with Strunke, one in which Jdchamp would have been welcome to join in had he had more to say than the """"I demand administrator intervention"""", """"You two are working together"""", type accusations he's been making.

I explained my reasons. The nearest thing I did at the time that came to being uncivil was pointing out that deliberately making changes against consensus can be seen by many of us as vandalism.

If demand is high and supply is low, price is high... etc.  Petroleum can be stored in many places, such as in the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve (727 million barrels).  Global strategic petroleum reserves hold over 4 billion barrels.  Supply, which is the refined petroleum (and other liquids) available in the open market, is affected by releases of strategic reserves (note that production is not the same as supply).  Depending on the source you read demand and usage might not even be the same thing, as demand might include buyers for strategic reserves.  

Most of the big issues with Peak oil begin with the fact that until recently demand has grown very steadily for a long time, catching up with production.  When production can not go up anymore (and begins to decline), the strategic reserves will slowly be used up until supply also begins to decline.  Then usage will be forced to decline, but demand could theoretically keep going up (imagine a room with one cupcake, full of people yelling for more).

You clearly know very little about the repertoire of the 10-string guitar and as little about the difference between multi-string guitars and the type of guitar that Narciso Yepes invented (which is NOT simply a multi-stringed guitar or simply a 10-stringED guitar). It MUST be defined separately from multi-string guitars because of its primary characteristic and raison d'etre, which are characteristics NOT shared by other multi-string guitars. It belongs under Classical Guitar, and it deserves its own definition. Neither your ignorance nor your bias against Yepes nor your preference for your own favourite guitarists will stop the truth from coming out!

Also, please educate yourself as regards the repertoire for the 10-string guitar rather than claiming stupidly and falsely that no one of any significance but Ohana ever wrote music for 10-stringed guitars. You are not informing anyone, only showing your own bias and/or ignorance.

 Some tips for making your stubs a bit better 

Apart from your over-reliance on Soccerway (which isn't always a WP:RS), I've noticed there are some other aspects of your created articles which need substantial improvement. Typing """"player who plays"""" is poor English, try to put """"footballer who plays..."""" or """"soccer player who represents..."""" The word """"currently"""" is pretty pointless too - I mean, they either play for the team or they don't, right? Also, try not to say they play for Bayern Munich in the Frauen-Bundesliga. Put of the Frauen-Bundesliga instead, because they play matches for their teams outside the league too. Please remember to always put the stub tags at the bottom of the article, this will draw attention to the fact that your creations require expansion and improvement. These are just small suggestions, but hopefully by taking this advice you will get better and eventually take some steps on the path to becoming a worthwhile contributor. Thanks,   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Child Porn Charges

It is noteworthy that instead of watching his daughter and protecting her, Mark Lunsford was allegedly busy on the internet viewing child pornography. Ironically, many of the """"Jessica's laws"""" that Lunsford fought so hard to get on the books dealt heavy blows to viewers of child porn, like Mark Lunsford, yet, Lunsford was never prosecuted under the existing federal laws for viewing child porn which would have landed Lunsford in federal prison and required him to register as a sex offender. Contained in the documents released by the State Attorney's office were notes from the Florida Department of Law Enforcement that mention child pornography on Mark Lundsford computer. The images & documents were found Feb. 24 — the day Jessica was reported missing from her South Sonata Avenue home — Assistant State Attorney Pete Magrino said the images were found on Lunsford's computer. However, he said his office is not pursuing charges. [3]

Plastic Surgery

Lunsford surprised many in July 2007 when he appeared in the media having undergone several cosmetic surgeries, including a face lift, dermabrasion, and eye surgery. 4

Father of Child Molester

In 2007, Joshua Lunsford, Mark Lunsford's son was arrested for having molested a 14 year old girl in Ohio. Despite Lunsford's public attack on all sex offenders, he seemed to be ready and willing to defend his own son's sex crimes and in fact may have played a vital role in the unequal treatment of Mark's sexual predator son. Joshua Lunsford was ordered to undergo sex offender evaluation but special treatment was administered and Joshua avoided felony charges and sex offender registration.[5]""",0,0,0,0,0,0

It's better to go by the AEC than the ABC. Refer to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Australian_politics/Archive_2#Election_campaign_articles where we established consensus that 0-5.99/6-10/>10 should be used for this page.    

Per the link above, the Australian Electoral Commission as well as SA's State Electoral Office use 0-5.99 marginal, 6-10 fairly safe, and >10 safe. On wiki we have also used >20 as v.safe. This is what has been agreed upon per the consensus in the link above and is used on all pages that relate to it such as the other link above. Thanks.     
    
Ah. Well, per the link above, there is a ref which is http://www.unsw.adfa.edu.au/hass/staff/pendulum_new.pdf - a very good resource, post-redistribution, and then the standard 2004 results from the AEC which are in the division page refs, such as http://results.aec.gov.au/12246/results/HouseDivisionFirstPrefs-12246-190.htm .     
    
No sorry.     
    
Nice work with all the infoboxes, but it was previously agreed here that infoboxes were superfluous to the article (you'll note that I preferred them to be included). In the interests of consensus, please raise this issue at the above link before adding any more, otherwise there may be a lot of removal, as I had to do earlier! Thanks.     
    
On another note, can I suggest that the infoboxes include the electorate's namesake?      
   
Additionally (I sound like I'm quibbling, I know - I do like the look of the new infoboxes) - are you able to make a template? This would make the inclusion and maintenance of the infoboxes much, much easier.      
    
The ones being used for the Sydney ones are out of date, representing the electorates as of 2004. I don't know if the others are uploaded yet.      
   
I've fixed the template up now, and changing them to templates. I hope you don't mind, but I removed some of the categories - I don't think anywhere provides information on population or density, and the """"last election"""" section is redundant as there's a table on that further down - and (I don't know if this was you) I'm making the allegiances according to the marginal-fairly safe-safe criteria used on the AEC, and I added the classification (inner metropolitan etc.) to the tables. If there are any problems with this please let me know!

Mr. Swordfish, you wrote """"it would be absurd say it was the other way around, i.e. to insist that you are making the bus speed up by pressing on the back of your seat.""""

Did you mean to say, """"it would be absurd say it was the other way around, i.e. to insist that you are creating a force on your back by accelerating."""" ?

I think so.  You were making the (good) point that simply reversing F and a in the cause and effect statement seems intuitively absurd in this case.  But the F in statement 1 is the forward force exerted on the back, not the backward force by the back, and the a is the acceleration of the person, not of the bus.

If we make the reversal one of switching equal and opposite forces carefully, we come up with """"The backward force of the back on the bus causes the acceleration of the bus to be lower than it otherwise would be"""" which is different than the way you wrote it.  In this case there is no intuitive absurdity at all.  Both cause and effect statements are equally intuitive.

Crowsfoot is right that F=ma, or its fluid dynamics equivalent, doesn't by itself indicate an asymmetric cause and effect relationship.  If causes must precede effects, then we could even argue that F=ma forbids a either causal interpretation, since it refers to instantaneous values of both F and a (and m).  

But its helpful to the reader, I think, to go with the intuitively appealing bias that net forces (pressure differences) cause accelerations (of bodies or particles, or for us, of differential volumes of fluid).  The real difficulty comes when the reader wants to know if the pressure field is caused by the flow field, or vice versa.  We must get him/r to abandon this truly meaningless question, I believe, and understand that Newton's differential equation, and the continuity and mass conservation constraints all have to hold at the same time.  The infinite set of 3d velocity vectors and the infinite set of local pressures have to be consistent with each other, and there is no intuitively meaningful way to say that one causes the other.

Hi Blnguyen, how are you ? Comin to the point, I am quite dissapointed by the way you have handled the Belgaum issue. I know Mahawiki has sometimes violated some rules, but remember that he was provoked to do so. You gave a warning on Mahawiki's page but you didn't warn any of the Kannada editors. If you don't know, all four(?) of them, Sarvagnya, KNM, Naveenbm and Gnanapiti had questioned the verifiability of the reference Mahawiki had provided. But had anyone else questioned it ? Still, Mahawiki e-mailed the file to everyone, then he uploaded it. Tell me wasn't all this done in good faith. Then these guys """"trashed"""" his citation. What were you doing then ? You should've warned them. Mahawiki had to provide an online link to the article, which he has now provided. I think these same rules should apply to them as well. I question the verifiablity of Suryanath Kamat. Even if Suryanath Kamat may be a good writer (which I know he is not), but is what Kannambadi filling pages with, the same thing from the book. Kannambadi may be filling something else. And references from a single book could be WP:NEO. What about that ? And another thing, the way you replied on Kannambadi's page reeked of bias and partisan attitude. Really, I was never so dissapointed on Wikipedia. You know, when Mahawiki used yo get dissapointed, I would always tell him to keep faith in Wikipedia's admins. And I always believed the admins would never be prejudiced.

Your edit and addition were valid and correct, and arguably warranted, and I would never revert what you put it, because it happens to be referenced and sourced and what's stated by majority scholarship on this issue.

And again, the point of Wilson and Cahill was in the context of the very section and paragraphs themselves, of rationalizing or explaining why Egypt herself never chronicalized things like the  10 plagues or the Hebrew exodus out of Egyptian slavery etc, or the destruction of Egyptian charioteers and soldiers or of that then reigning king of Egypt.   Of course majority historians discount it ever actually happening, but it's also known and admitted (as a general point) that ancient pagan nations or kingdoms in general would not always be so honest or straightforward or complete in their recording of everything.   Embellishing some facts and details, while minimizing or even totally hiding others.   And that was really the point.   Anyway, thanks for your work on it too.

 Are redlinks bad form? 
 regarding the Co-Freemasonry article: 

I was under the impression that redlinks in articles were quite acceptable, as long as they point to (nonexistent) articles on notable subjects that could or should be created. I could reinstate the links and create stubs for them all, but that would involve quite a bit of work; isn't the point that redlinks serve as useful signposts for others who might be able to contribute material? I'd like to put at least some of the redlinks back in...

In fact, I've just done a quick search and found Wikipedia:Red link, which agrees with what I thought. I'll add the redlinks back, checking as I go to make sure they're all notable and desirable articles. ☻ 

Check it, Fuzz: Wikipedia:Only make links that are relevant to the context. I agree, not all of them exactly need to be removed, but there's too many. Check policy, determine what should be linked, & relink it...:-)  

Righto, I have checked it, and I stick by my position. None of the redlinks should be removed. They are all relevant to the article. Please excuse me if I'm being dense, but which particular redlinks do you believe are irrelevant? Some of the blue-linked dates should be unlinked (those not containing both month and day, as per Wikipedia:Dates); apart from that, the links in the article are fine. ☻ 

Whatev's...;~) the idea of leaving many red links in is to give people an idea of articles which should probably be created, especially in a newly-created article. If they stay too long, &/or the article becomes long-of-tooth, then they should almost always be removed. Obviously, do as you feel best. I'm for sure not going to express too much care, not there...  

Thank-you for your comments. I'm not too worried now. I've run roughshod over people in the past, and I know how easy it is to do. At the moment I'm probably in danger of running roughshod over some of the people who claim to be Wiccan but have no initiatory lineage. Just as you don't consider Co-Freemasons to be Freemasons, I don't consider them to be Wiccan. The thing is, everyone editing here is doing so because there's a subject that's important to them, so there are bound to be disagreements. I feel like we're all on the same side, though, ultimately: our goal is to establish truth (or rather the wikipedia equivalent, verifiability), regardless of how many of our preconceived opinions are sacrificed in the process. ☻

Cinema C is again making disrupting editing without consensus, without discussing on the subject. 

Kosovo is a state, a sovereign and independent. Not even disputed. 

1) Serbia defacto recognizes Kosovo

2) Serbia tacitly recognizes Kosovo

3) Serbia establishes border and custom control with Kosovo

4) Serbia does not control Kosovo, defacto nor dejure

5) Serbia recognizes the international subjectivity of Kosovo as an independent sovereign body.
 
6) Most Serb media, like Beta and Fonet, clearly use Nis (Naissus) as a southern town. 

7) Serbia president needs permission of the Republic of Kosovo to visit

8) Serb leaders are now allowed to enter through customs and borders.
 
9) Regions are geographic names, if we use region that definitely, Nis, Novi Pazar should be included because they are both part of Kosovo region, not Serbia. 

10) Territory is when controls, but the inhabitants refuse to recognize the legitimacy of the ruler. Palestine. 

11) Kosovo fulfills all the criteria of a sovereign state, with several UN bodies recognizes it, such as IMF, World Bank and other world institutions. 

12) Serbia willing to establish diplomatic relations with Kosovo if some territory is swapped, obviously, Serbia cares about territory, because it already recognizes Kosovo. 

13) Invalidity of Serb passports to Kosovar citizens. Not even, Kosovar Serbs can travel to EU. So much, about the dispute.

SpanishBoy2006 

We all agreed that Kosovo is a disputed state, until Cinema made disruptive changes, without consensus, leading warrants and locking. SpanishBoy2006 

Kosovo is not disputed at all because Kosovo was never part of serbia it was part of Yugoslavia

 needs balanced perspective 

Climate change should be discussed with global warming entry – they are one and the same thing.

This has to be a balanced discussion also discussing the forecasts and uncertainties in forecasting temperature / CO2 increase which are proposed as the causes of the examples of climate change that are presented.

Discuss the politicization (sp?) of the entire issue, the role of IPCC, of Gore etc.  This is very much at the heart of the attention and emphasis being given.  

Discussion of post 1950s warming does not mention the pre 1950s temperature drop that is not explained by the forcings and “predictive” climate models. 

The forecasts / predictions are major part of the actual basis for the attention and emphasis in the carefully planned publicity campaign of the IPCC.  IPCC readily acknowledges that their role is to expand awareness to provide push for policy makers.  The 90 / 95 / etc. probabilities are without merit, are not based on independent scientific fact but Delphi polling of scientists who are doing the scientific modeling.  In fact, IPCC acknowledge that it is not possible to predict the future trajectory which is why they are developing scenarios not forecasts.  Scenarios assume a set of initial values or base starting points for the forcings and forecast how these forcings will play out over time.  This does not adequately take into account technological change that is and will continue to occur.  None of this is identified and discussed in this entry.

In this regard, some analogies with Thomas Malthus """"An Essay on the Principle of Population"""" (1798), [aka """"Malthusian catastrophe, Malthusian crisis, Malthusian dilemma, Malthusian disaster, Malthusian trap, or Malthusian limit (Wikipedia)], Paul Ehrlich """"The Population Bomb"""" (1968), Club of Rome """"Limits to Growth"""" (1972), as well as Orsen Well radio case of H.G. Wells """"War of the Worlds"""" (1936) as an example of how the media can be an  effective force in public opinion.

Both in the US and UK court rulings do not allow presenting / discussing the climate change issues without a balanced view of the issues such as mentioned here.  Wikipedia entries should also be required to be required to meet the same standards in presenting balanced views. 

The need for climate change policy is  based on economic evaluation of the future pattern of costs vs. benefit.  The Stern review – which is discussed – has been strongly criticized in peer reviewed journals because of its assumptions and approaches which very greatly favor support the recommendations, which is neither scientific or intellectually honest.  See e.g., the following references.

You seem to have missed the line at the very beginning: 'for current global climate change see global warming'. Merging them would be like merging the history of the United States with the 2008 presidential election...  

The global warming page in the terminology section states that global warming is an example of climate change, a subset as it were. The way these two articles are broken up is completely wrong. 122.104.2.224  

How so? Global climate change is purely the projected change of the climate. Global warming is an example of climate change - it is the heating of the climate. However, if temperatures drop, which many people believed before, that too would be global climate change. 
I do, however, agree that this page needs to be expanded.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • [[Special:Co",0,0,0,0,0,0

The idea is that tetrapods that grows slowly (i.e reptiles) continue to grow in maturity. Both the steadily increasing size of the jaws and the wear and tear imposed by a long life dictate continued change of teeth. Mammalian teeth being complex, replacing teeth requires quite a bit of resources, and as anyone having children of pre-school age can attest to, it is also a lot of bother (try eating an apple without your front teeth!). Thus, for the fast-living, high energy demanding life of insectivorous mammals, tooth replacement is kept to an minimum (i.e two setts, a trait retained in their descendants). How do you propose going about explaining it without making it a disproportionally large part of the article? Or is it so important it should be a large part?",0,0,0,0,0,0

I work with enterobacteria every day and phage therapy was discussed on an expert meeting I went to. Phage therapy was exhumed recently but most of us see the therapeutic potential overrated particular by the mass media. That is not to say that there is no potential but there is too much evidence against a widespread use. I think we all would like to have good handle in the light of multiresistant strains.

There is no real track record of tests that were carried out in the west but as far as we know some attempts were made in early years (failures are rarely published). There are newer test in the literature carried out in the food industry and in mice.
The idea that things were """"forgotten in the West"""" is often used to give weight to arguments but in modern research there is hardly anything left that is not written in English. There is a lot of information on the web that we should take into account, including positive arguments for phage therapy, for instance this review. 

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db;=pubmed&dopt;=Abstract&list;_uids=16258815
 
However, even in the postive light that the review draws, one should not forget about the severe problems that need to be tackled. Note that the problems of resistance also present phage therapy, the added amount of time to find the course of the infection and the massive allergic reactions you could provoke by phage particles.

 I think that """"a family of paradoxes"""" is more technically accurate, if you re-read the literature section you'll see why Hillman (the originator of this wording) described them this way.  Different authors have analyzed slightly different situations using different means.

 I also think accelerated rods are quite relevant and related (again, I borrowed this from Hillman, though I added the wiki-link to Born rigid motion).  Note that we are currently arguing accelerated motion with Rod Ball.  I would say that the topic is therfore closely related, though not identical.  That's just what the intro says.  Strings and spaceships share much of the same physics as rods and spaceships, in the final analysis.  It's fundamentally about distance.

 I think both versions contain equivalent information in explaining why the paradox, originated by Dewan and Beran, is named after Bell.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

The interior of the fictional Masyaf citadel in Assassin's Creed contains an extensive library, and the rear is a lush garden above a sheer drop. These two properties happen to be known features of the real Alamut, which was also a Hashashin fortress at this time. Subsequently, it is likely that the fictional Masyaf is a combination of features of both fortresses.

It may also be the case that the in-game character Al-Mualim (""""teacher"""") is a portrayal of the real Rashid ad-Din Sinan, who was operating out of Masyaf at the time the game is set. Both characters are the leaders of the Masyaf citadel. In addition, both ad-Din Sinan and the fictional Al-Mualim die around the same point in time (e.g. 1192-4 compared to 1191). So there certainly are elements of the real Masyaf which have carried into the game, albeit modified. 

At any rate, a reference to Assassin's creed should only be made under the Popular Culture heading.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Hs Khalsa Recommendations 

I have several suggestions for how the Sikhism page can be improved.  I plan to list them below, one at a time, allowing time for comment on them before making the relevant changes.  After a suggestion has been considered and approved or rejected, I will move on to my next suggestion.

1)  """"The followers of Sikhism are ordained to follow the teachings of the Ten Sikh Gurus and the select works of fifteen earlier bhagats as scripted in the Gurū Granth Sahib.""""

Problem: I feel this sentence is misleading.  As you know, the writings of only six Gurus are included in Guru Granth Sahib.  Perhaps this sentence is not meant to suggest that all ten Gurus are included.  However, a second issue arises because there are more authors than just fifteen bhagats included in Guru Granth Sahib as implied by the second part of the sentence.  

Solution:  """"The followers of Sikhism are ordained to follow the teachings of the ten (lowercase 'T') Sikh Gurus, as well as (no 'the') Guru Granth Sahib which includes select works of numerous authors from diverse backgrounds.""""

If this is not detailed enough, perhaps all relevant authors could be listed.  In any case, just stating """"fifteen earlier bhagats"""" is factually incorrect.  Further, the emphasis of the Gurus was not on the background of the authors, but on what they had to say about God.

I also propose removing 'the' from in front of Guru Granth Sahib.  Guru Granth Sahib is not a thing.  It is not acceptable or appropriate to call Guru Nanak Dev - the Guru Nanak, or to call Guru Gobind Singh - the Guru Gobind.  Similarly, Guru Granth Sahib is a Guru of equal stature.  I know writing """"the Guru Granth Sahib"""" is extremely prevalent all over the Web, but we at Wikipedia should consider the merits of the case and hold ourselves to higher standards rather than just going with what is most popular.

So I hope you will oppose any version of FR that would not have prevented this case, as not being fit for purpose. In just the same way that a retraction will be due from Jimbo if he somehow comes up with a proposal that would not have """"100% prevented"""" the Ted Kennedy incident.

I hope that you might also realise that if in your words the case here is """"thankfully relatively rare"""", why many people would then think that applying a blanket measure such as Flagged Revisions is not very appropriate at all. I contrast it as the British Government contending every citizen must be forced to carry an identity card, on the presumption that is the best way you can catch terrorists, which happen to also be """"thankfully relatively rare"""". Why not for example in this specific case take a more intelligent approach, and implement sopmething that prevents or flags any edit that adds the word """"molesting"""", instead of forcing onto all BLP articles an incredibly blunt and incredibly bad faith assuming measure? (and any interested observers, please, stop before you say it, these valid concerns with what FR is/could be cannot all just be washed away by referring to the quite irrelevant 'advantage' of FR of opening up the tiny minority of protected articles).

And to further address the specific example you give, maybe you can expand on why anybody would be likely to believe that one sentence claim, when it was added to the article along with another 15 sentences, which at best hint at the whole thing being a hoax, and at worst, screams delete me now for being total WP:BOLLOCKS. We can also discuss how an editor in between the vandalism and your removal 'fixes the article for typos'  without noticing that it is 90% complete bollocks? Even when one of the typos is a few words away from the molesting red flag. A systemic failure perhaps?

And finally, as an admin, perhaps you can tell me why the IP user is not now blocked, irrespective of how long ago the edit occurred. Incidentally, the now famous bad account on Ted Kennedy was also not blocked immmediately after his first edit was a BLP violation on an unrelated article. Another systemic failure?

I'm all for criticla analysis of cases 'FR would have prevented', because they frequently pose more questions than they answer, about the whole model of Wikipedia, never mind how we efficiently and intelligently prevent BLP violations.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

The main idea for chapter two, Nonverbal communication: its origins and development, is the awareness of events around the child such as gaze and gesture interaction, facial expressions, and modifying emotional expressiveness. """"With age, children's encoding (sending messages) and decoding (interpreting messages) skills increase. Yet children are better at decoding than at encoding, a fact suggesting that nonverbal comprehension precedes production"""" (Haslett, B. B., & Samter, W., 1997, p. 35). This fact represents interpersonal communication and how it improves with age in children. 
The main point for chapter three, The development of language, is the social development based on the environment of the child. """"Children's nonverbal communication skills, especially those developed through interactional synchrony with adult caretakers, foreshadow the conversational exchanges that typify interpersonal communication."""" (Haslett, B. B., & Samter, W., 1997, p. 57) Good interpersonal communication starts from the beginning with infant communication, mainly nonverbal, and so it translates to the developmental skills to attain high levels of communication. This chapter also touches on stages in language development which is a slight alternative idea to explain parts of interpersonal developmental process. The stages include prelinguistic development, speech perception/production, semantic development, private speech, and first words. 
Also, the main idea for chapter four, Developing verbal communication and how its relevant in children's acquisition of a variety of communicative strategies for attaining goals. A main focus is """"discussing the communicative intentionally substage of development"""" for infants """"emerging abilities to control their communicative skills"""" (Haslett, B. B., & Samter, W., 1997, p. 105). All three chapters contribute to a more concise understanding of language how it contributes to the ideas of interpersonal communication development in young children.

Your accusations are false and malicious. You hurl accusations to justify your attempt to enhance POV editing in the article. There has indeed been bullying on the article but it has been directed AT me, not by me. You are obviously looking at this is a very biased manner. You punish Wikid for making a joke about a swine that offended The Magnificent Clean-Keeper. Yet, you punish me when I complain about horrible words being directed at me, including the repeated use of the """"F"""" word by The Magnificent Clean-Keeper towards me. There has been a great deal of harassment directed towards me, yet you totally ignore it or never looked into it. Then you make the totally false charge that I  misused mediation. That is outrageous. The mediator turned out to have a srong bias. He could not fulfill the role of an impartial mediator, in my opinion. To say that rejecting a mediator who had openly expressed a strong bias is wrongful is just more bias on your part. I agree that Wikipedia is not an advocacy site, and that is the exact point I have tried to make.

Research on Italian Somalians

I appreciate your improvements,Middayexpress. I have done some research on books about the Italian Somalians and I hope you can find what you need. 

About the catholicism in Somalia, here it is the exact words in the Tripodi book:""""Il vescovo di Mogadiscio, don Franco Filippini, dichiarava nel 1940 che vi erano circa 40.000 Somali cattolici, frutto del lavoro missionario specialmente nelle aree agricole del Giuba e dell'Uebi Scebeli"""" (my translation: the Bishop of Mogadischu, Franco Filippini, stated in 1940 that there were nearly 40,000 native Somalians of catholic faith, consequence of the missions mainly in the agricultural areas of the rivers Juba and Schebelle). If we add that there were 22,000 Italians in Somalia in that year and the aproximate population of Italian Somalia was calculated in 750,000 (there were no exact census), we have to agree to what writes Tripodi: 62,000 catholics in Italian Somalia (to whom we have to add the temporary Italian troops stationed in forts), or nearly 10% of the total population of 750,000. Of course there are other calculations of the 1940 population of Italian Somalia without the Ogaden, but most scholars agree in the 750,000 - 800,000 range.

I have written that 'The Italian Embassy calculated in 1993 that most Italian colonists used to have illegitimate children with Somali women and this fact has created a group of Italian Somalians with Italian roots, that now amount to nearly 50,000 descendants in all Somalia', because in page 38 Paolo Tripodi wrote the following:L'ambasciatore italiano considerava l'uso del concubinato un serio problema durante gli anni della colonia. Un problema che aveva generato -secondo lui- quasi 50.000 Somali con almeno un nonno o bisnonno italiano negli anni novanta. (my translation: the italian ambassador believed that the wide practice of concubinage during the colonial years had created the problem that nearly 50,000 Somalians had at least one grandfather or a greatgrandfather Italian during the nineties).

It was an explanation of my perception at the time, and not some type of value judgment. But if you really want an answer to your question, I'd say an editor is no longer a newbie when they have a reasonable command of how Wikipedia works, such that they do not make false accusations of copyright infringement, make a point of communicating with image uploaders, and familiarize themselves with the right way to communicate with members of the community.

Speedy deletion of Mass (Masud)
 A tag has been placed on Mass (Masud), requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section G4 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be a repost of material that was previously deleted following a deletion debate, such as at articles for deletion. Under the specified criteria, where an article has substantially identical content to that of an article deleted after debate, and any changes in the content do not address the reasons for which the material was previously deleted, it may be deleted at any time. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the article (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay.

Forwarding is the process of actually sending data. It depends on routing, but routing can occur without forwarding.

Routing does not depend on having an aggregatable address.  For example, prefixes blocks on the Internet today are becoming less aggregatable.  This is a problem for BGP's scalability, but it doesn't make BGP less of a routing protocol.  In fact, there exist routing protocols which need no concept of an address at all, such as ROFL , distributed hash tables, many ad hoc routing protocols like DSDV, and various proposals in a research area known as """"compact routing"""" . In these protocols nodes have unique names but not addresses.

There may be more narrow senses of the word """"routing"""", but for the purposes of this encyclopedia article, I would say bridging is a type of routing.

To adopt your analogy, Ed Johnston is the systems manager guy in the wikioffice, with seniority, wide knowledge of the way it best functions, and a demonstrated capacity for making judgements all sides accept as neutral, and he's telling a less experienced wikipedian how this peculiar society works.  Most serious, professional writers, scholars and thinkers find this place exasperating and refuse to help out. Some just learn to bite the bullet, wear the bullshit, adapt to suppressing the 'Ah, you fucken dopey arsehole' sort of thought that passes one's article-parsing mind from hour to hour, and write instead, 'you're mistaken' or even 'you screwed up'. Of course there are lots of ignoramuses and liars here, like everywhere in the world and in every sphere of activity. Here, the rule is, if you want to lie or push a POV against the evidence, as long as you stick to the AGF rules, you can enjoy longevity while enjoying exhibitions of suicide by people who call you out. That looks outrageous, at first glance, but without it, tens of thousands of quite good quality articles on difficult and controversial topics would never have been written. Anthropologists, when studying a tribe in field research, understand that they must adapt, provisorily, to the rules of the tribe: back in their professorial armchair, a different discourse obtains which, were it thrown the tribe's way would (a) only be offensive (b) obstruct the acquisition of a tribe's ethnography and (c) ultimately, be detrimental to the tribe itself, which down the line may well need that expert's return to assist it in adapting in turn to a larger world outside of its own mental confines.

 Incorrect ambiguous name 

OK guys, the list is interesting and important, but it's name is ambiguous for following reasons:
encyclopedically, not all former Soviet republics joined CIS. Some of the CIS members are going to withdraw from the Commonwealth. But all of them certainly do use (or maybe modernize) military aircraft, mostly those Soviet-designed. Thus, the name is unadequately narrowing the subject
practically, CIS is not a purely military organization (or rather mostly non-military). Moreover, some of its members never joined th CIS military institutions and are seeking NATO membership. That's why CIS definition has little in common with military aviation equipment.

Every school in the board uses this IP, and I can only help the problem in my school's libraray. I caught several students vandalizing the page Plate Tectonics today, and I was able to revert the spam edits without haste. They have been suspended from the library for a week. 

With co-operation of other librarians and teachers, hopefully we can curb this vandalism in all of our schools. Until then, I will not mind the IP blocks, as I have my own home Wikipedia account in which I can edit from, and I will continue to help you in any way I possibly can.

Instead of just stating what should be done, be bold and provide sources to prove that they're not, or use Wikipedia policy to disprove the current references as credible, such as I am about to do. Reference 2 (NME) is a questionable source because it is full of personal opinions and bias. And reference 3 (New York Times) states that """"Paramore is loosely affiliated with the world of emo"""". Is loose affiliation enough to place Paramore in the Emo genre? I'm going to be bold, and say no; this is probably going to start some edit war, but I'm removing the Emo genre from the page as per WP:QS. Without credible sources, I will hunt down sources which prove they are not of the Emo genre and place them on this talk page. And before anyone points at the Joshua Martin quote saying that it proves they're emo, that is a writer's personal opinion of what they think Paramore's music sounds like. It would be like saying... French toast is bread, but with icing sugar, and its less healthy; yet French toast and bread aren't the same thing. They may seem similar, and may have qualities of each other, but they don't taste, look, smell, or feel like each other... and in before """"French toast isn't Paramore"""", it's an analogy...

 Heavily biased section named as Death on 18 August 1945 

The bias in the section named as Death on 18 August 1945, is very much conspicuous, very much unbecoming of Wikipedia. There is a literary effort to establish unconfirmed events in the veil of so-called """"scholarly opinion"""".  It appears the page is intentionally silent on the report of the last commission and the inquiry commission by Taiwan Government, the country in which the air crash was alleged to take place. It is another matter, but quite relevant, that Taiwan itself has denied this crash having ever taken place.  But what is most irritating is the last paragraph, where there is a emphasis on shock, disbelief at so-called death in India, which gives a lead into a suspicion that everything (even an Inquiry Commission report perhaps!) are all babies of this disbelief.  There are pictures like Renkoji temple, or newspapers reports published at that time which unsuccessfully try to uphold the the death theory, but keeping silent on the other theories, increases the suspicion of a using this page as a tool to publish own opinions rather than information.

The Wikipedia entry then appears to be summarising his book rather than using it as a partial reference. Kinsey has a new book coming out on the Elstree years which will no doubt be useful in this department, alongside the other books. However, I would have thought that the purpose of a further reading list is to provide other sources of information on a subject that the reader of the Wikipedia article can consult to find out more about Hammer in this instance.

I don't recommend that she be unblocked any time soon (I really don't see any evidence that she has ever substantially contributed to the encyclopedia, and I have no reason to believe that she would start doing so were we to unblock her), but I may have been mistaken in identifying her with the program vandals she shared an open proxy with.

 I can and do accuse you of [[pa[trolling.]] like a [[Nazi][storm trooper]].

Dear Bishonon

questions: 

Is there any excuse for how they treated me and other newcomers, or anyone that questions them?

I can't answer questions without any information in them, sorry. You'll have to link me to some of the posts from these users that you're complaining about. I'd appreciate diff links, but I realize you're new and may have trouble making them. But at least tell me the page, the date, and the time.

 I find this statement fascinating in light of your assertions (below). 
 You have obviously looked around on some of the article edits in question. Why didn't you look at anything else? If you knew where to look at edits on the Dem Party article, I would assume you would know where to look for our dialogues.
 You keep making accusations at me and then state that you know nothing about the situation. This is hilarious.

That said, I expect I can recognize what you call """"how they treated you"""", """"ganging up"""", etc, if I see it. A sincere thank you for that (recognize ganging up).

 I wasn't asking for that exactly. But now that you mention it, if you don't know much about American politics I don't think you should be getting involved in my edits concerning American politics. The article reads, for the most part like a giant advertisement for the Democratic Party. It's improving now because I stood up to these...yes.. bullies.

With 140 articles about 9 have been deleted.  This isn't a horrible percentage. This is under 10%.  Considering that most of the individuals who were deleted were African American Judo fighters, I pointed out that statistic, to which they claimed I claimed I said they were racist or bigoted.  I never stated anyone was a racist or a bigot.  I pointed out a statistic.  After this issue was closed, one user tried to revive the issue, to which an admin stated """".

 EON - Bond Franchise 

EON.

This company was set up, so it says on BBC Radio 4 at the moment, as a production company for Roger Moore, Cubbi Broccoli and various others on the James Bond franchise. Sean Connery possibly. I am just going off the wireless and I am sure it is well documented, but can't set it down verbatim. I heard it on Sunday this is the repeat on Friday morning.

EON stood for """"Everything or Nothing"""", according to Livvy Purves' intro. Obviously not connected to the other names. Surprised it hasn't an entry, what to do of it?

So at some point something about it has to go back in. The other is that most modern historians of science (Larson, Bowler, Gould) treat the foundation of population genetics as the start (Gould calls it the first phase) of the modern synthesis, not part of the run up to it. I realize this view differs somewhat from the view of Mayr who emphasizes more the later parts of the synthesis that involved the integration of other fields of biology with population genetics as the actual synthesis, but on this point I think, the article needs to follow the views of most current historians of science rather than those of Mayr or the other participants. There is a reason why historians do not rely exclusively on first person accounts of the participants in an event, and the biggest has to do with perspective.

This is not to say there is 100% direct correlation, but indeed some of the massive waves of the exodus were reactions to the anti-Jewish riotings, violance and killings and this is partialy what the paragraph describes.
As for the use of the term """"fled"""" - it's a good middlepoint between """"emmigrated"""" end """"expelled"""" that shows the element of fear was an important factor in the decision to leave, which is true and can't be ignored. The term is used twice: once for the 30,000 Jews who fled Llibya in the years 1949-1951 and second for Jews fleeing Egypt post-1948. In both cases I think the use of the term is appropriate.

The link between tobacco and cancer was first hypothesized as a carcinogen in 1898, with the first animal experiments finally producing demonstrable evidence for the link in the 1930s.  The scientific consensus for lung cancer from tobacco first formed in the 1950s. Because of the constant """"doubt is our product"""" propaganda from the tobacco industry, the public did not fully become cognizant of the risk until thirty years after the science was solid.

This is the first article I nominate to GA-review, please tell me if I miss anything. walk victor falk talk 

What about those taken prisoner by the British/Allies in the Middle East. Also those who refused to join the Free French in Britain and were repatriated back to France.?   
I respect this point, but we're talking about close on two million people in prisoner of war camps in Germany. That's what the scholarship covers and it's that which is covered by reliable sources establishing notability. Everything else, a tiny fraction by comparison, is generally only mentioned as a footnote to a general history of the campaign. Yes, French soldiers were probably taken prisoner from Indochina to Britain, North Africa to the Middle East. But they pale into insignificance when compared with the 2 million in Germany and this is why all the titles on the bibliography talk about French prisoners but only deal with the German-held ones. So I see your point, but I can't really do anything about it. It just isn't out there. '  
  Yesterday I was editing Free_France#Syria_and_East_Africa, and as it mentioned how only 5000 out of 40000 chose to join Free France while the rest wanted to be rapatriated, my immediate spontaneous/instinctive reaction was to wish for something like [[French WWII POWs#Vichy prisoners]] to target in this article. However, as  notes, some probably existed but their numbers are vanishlingly small and the result of special circumstances, such as beeing spies, obvious traitors & collaborators and suchlike that does not fall in what is considered a POW by international conventions; For the allies, rank and file Vichy troops were always offered a choice of repatriation, no questions asked, and their incarceration as POWs always a temporary affair.  I can think that more conventional perhaps such existed as Axis and especially Japanese ones after the coup in March 1945 eliminated any fiction of Vichy rule in Indochina, but sources about that might be very elusive to find; and anyway, probably more within the scope of the """"POWs held by the Japanese"""" wikipedia article. At the most, a short sentence summarising the above might be added somewhere, to dispell the same curiosity from readers that you've shown. walk victor falk talk

This article is suppose to be about Japanese Animation (Japanese Animation redirects here and under Animation related topics if you click Japan it links here), this article is called Anime, because it's suppose to be a synonym. But in this article Anime is not clearly defined as Japanese Animation, it just says it usually refers to a style of animation originating in Japan and than says the term may also be used for other animation originating in Japan or to anime proper, irrespective of style. BUT it doesn't say what Anime is. If it isn't agreed that Anime is Japanese Animation, than this article should be renamed.

Edit 25 Nov 07
The anonymous editor immediately before me believed that they had """"deleted weasel words, tried to bring it back to a neutral perspective"""". The edit was a basic misunderstanding of the Secret History; I wouldn't be surprised if they hadn't read the work. The SH does indeed """"claim to"""" report, rather than """"report"""" scandals in Justinian's reign: the work remains completely uncorroborated by any other contemporary witness, and some of the purported scandals are so outrageous, the causes given by Procopius so bizarre and unknowable (viz., that Justinian was a devil and had the gift of invisibility), that much of it does not so much report anything as give vent to the bile of the author: that's why I let stand the deletion of """"apparently"""" (""""The Secret History apparently reveals an author who had become deeply disillusioned""""), since that particular word is a """"weasel word"""" on the part of some Wikipedia editor. But the so-called 'revelations' are indeed """"titillating (and doubtful)"""" rather than """"revealing"""" (and """"revealing revelations"""" is very bad copy editing, too). Similarly again, given that there is no doubt that the same author wrote both the SH and the Buildings, the panegyric of Justinian is undeniably insincere; since the Buildings bears the mark of official patronage in other respects, the panegyric can indeed be viewed as written at Justinian's behest, or something like it: stet.

I think it would be reasonable to delete the text below:

There is  contemporary Rubaiyat is by the Iranian poet SALAH AL-DIN IBN BIN DEEN called The Rubaiyat of SALAH AL-DIN IBN BIN DEEN This Rubaiyat uses a number of patterns ie AABA, AAAA. This Rubaiyat uses erotic images to explore a range of mystical experiences. The use of erotic imagery was  commonly used by Sufis in Sufi poetry. SALAH AL-DIN IBN BIN DEEN is well within this Sufi tradition 

Thy red flushed lips pouting moon-flower
Clutch the bee in thy humid bower
Entangled deep he cries for more
As thy wines nectar on him shower

Oh cup bearer bring thy wine don’t refrain
Up lift   thy porphyry cup that I may drain 
My lips to thy lips jar
Lips on cups rim I sip again and   again

Up turn thy cup cup bearer turns
Thy wine hotter than Karkhiya burns
The wine drips fromst thy hole like molten glass
It rim froths with bubbles in my lips churns

The text above may or may not be truthful in its claims of the Persian poet's existence; in any case the poet and translator are both non-notable as far as I can tell; the poetry, furthermore, is quite bad (at least in English; I don't know about the putative Persian), and the explanatory sentences don't inspire confidence in the writer's clarity of thought. The use was commonly used? Sufis used this technique in Sufi poetry?

Why not delete it all? If we do include it, the passage we quote from the new Rubaiyat should not be three times longer than our quotation from Fitzgerald's/Omar's.

Whether a particular comparison to Hitler or Nazis is rhetorically persuasive or is excessive (and thus weakens the impact of appropriate comparisons) is not a matter of hard, objective fact (validity, or truthfulness) but, at least in instances where reasonable minds might differ, a matter of subjective appropriateness and degree.

Several years ago the New York Times published a letter of mine, but edited out my correct use of the subjunctive case. When I questioned the editor (very politely and deferentially), he explained the subjunctive is no longer used in modern English except for an assertion contrary to fact (e.g., """"If the Earth were flat, then ..."""")—which my subjunctive usage in the letter happened to be, although I continue to use the subjunctive wherever it is grammatically correct. Was I asleep when the subjunctive case was ripped from my language? Did the Anglos [sic] and Saxons posthumously defeat the Romans and seize linguistic dominance while I was away?

When I was in 4th grade, the teacher taught the class said that it was incorrect to begin a sentence with because. I asked why, and gave her a grammatically correct example of the usage. She acknowledged that my example was correct, but said one should not begin a sentence with because because that often leads to error (she was probably concerned about sentence fragments, e.g., """"Because it rained.""""). To this day, probably because of my resentment of the teacher dumbing down the language, I begin a disproportionate proportion of my sentences with because.

carefully consider the language of your edits; This one  for example, uses the word """"highlight"""" which is a weasel word which promotes a particular view (also it is unsourced, and placed in the lead, and likely being given undue weight.

Hi Lulubyrd, would you be so kind as strike out or remove your post for the reasons I explained in the ANI thread? (Reader's digest version: because it's not true, I even gave you a diff, and because I'm bothered you'd say such things). If you would do, then perhaps I owe you an apology for not WP:AGFing and assuming you wouldn't. It's not like our paths will cross very often, if ever, but why not score another friend?

Like you said in the article talk, the sources I cited didn't support """"Sabbatic Witchcraft"""", and... hey now, believe it or not, I was aware of that. You are welcome. Polemics make it difficult to communicate effectively.. there was no dispute, and no good options... but if you had renamed the article Sabbatic Craft, no one would have undone it. Better still, if you had suggested deletion and mentioned there was already a writeup in Contemporary witchcraft, I would have been behind that 100%, (even just mentioning the latter, I'd have suggested the former), with redirect 'natch.

""""Sabbatic Current"""" works ok as a section header, but because it's so obscure, it couldn't be used for the article per the guidelines for WP:TITLE, and while """"Sabbatic Craft"""" would have been better in that regard, it's supposed to be proprietary—the kanundrum... In addition to struggling with the guideline, I was trying to find a way to go by what Chumbley said too... and that's consistent with what you thought WP should do, yes?

Do you have any concerns with the redirects for Sabbatic witchcraft and Sabbatic Craft?

It's a sure bet you know way more about Sabbatic Craft than I intend to learn. What did you think of the changes I made to Contemporary witchcraft#Sabbatic Current? Is there a particular section in the Chumbley article that would be good to point the Cultus Sabbati redirect to? (My impression was none in particular, but I only read it once through).

Can you please explain your edits to Biff Rose? They appear to express a negative POV towards the person. -Willmcw 06:55, August 6, 2005 (UTC)

For willmcw

I think its high time you stopped trying to rearrange my words. The information contained on the biff rose site colelcts the pertinent info. It is not a billboard for his achievements, but an overview of his career. I think records that were pressed and sold are of worth. Ones that were not around in copies more than fifty or a hundred are not. I've interviewed Rose, I know which ones sold and which ones didn't. You can beef up a discog with murky details, but it won't help the whole wiki crowd. Stop being bullheaded, and agressive, because though you've been given power through edits, you have also become that which you supposedly fight against. You are not allowing the newer versions of this piece to come to life, but instead are so closely guarding the information disseminated from within that you have become like a fascist. Terrible!!!

[left unsigned by user:Steve espinola at ]

Why do you delete the number of """"Carson"""" appearances? Why are you deleting the name of his biggest song? What does it matter to you if the records sold 10 or 10,000 copies? Do you have some personal animus towards Rose? Please note that your personal feelings, and your personally-obtained interviews, should not be used to influence the article. It's a biography, and should present a comprehensive picture of his life. It's not a place to gain revenge on someone you don't like. -Willmcw 20:21, August 6, 2005 (UTC)

Any info deleted was moved from prominence to more esoteric reading of it, to make the article read better, and have a decent flow. That Rose was in Time magazine once in 1965 is not of note. That he wrote a song that was covered by both Tiny Tim and David Bowie is. That that song was co written Oscar winning musician Paul Williams is important. Also of note, it should be mentioned that Rose has disavowed the Williams connection in several interviews, until in late 2004 on his own website's message board he admitted he was falsefying William's own involvement in the song. But a small 200 word blurb in time 50 years ago is not of worth. As for Rose's appearnaces on Carson, there has been no reall connection with the amount of times Rose officia",0,0,0,0,0,0

Hi Petebutt and thanks for all the hard work you're putting into expanding these lists. However, you're also causing quite a bit of chaos through, I think, unfamiliarity with how Wikilinks work.

To make a long story short, whatever goes inside the double-square brackets - [[ and ]] must be the name of the actual page that you're pointing to; if not, problems can occur. 

For example, in your recent edits to the Lockheed part of the list, you removed """"Lockheed"""" from some of the entries. This means that F-4 points to the Phantom II and U-2 points to a disambiguation page. If you want the link to appear different on the screen from the actual page name, we use what's called a """"pipe""""; for example - [[Lockheed U-2|U-2]] will appear as """"U-2"""" on the page, but take you to the Lockheed U-2 article (try it! - U-2).

Hope this helps! You might also like to check out WP:AIR, the WikiProject that exists to co-ordinate Wikipedia's aircraft content. Cheers   

On that subject-  I've just rolled back your last text dump - it's full of broken links, bad formatting, and inconsistencies both within itself and with these lists in general. Please take some time to try and understand how wikilinks work and how these lists are structured. If you have any questions, please feel free to leave a note on my talk page   

 Caudron C.230 

Hi again - apologies are unnecessary - we were all new here once! 

Thanks for the article on the Caudron C.230 - I've moved it across into the main part of the encyclopedia (you'd actually placed it on your """"userpage"""" - a page where contributors to Wikipedia may choose to introduce themselves, saying as much or as little about themselves as they want.) You can read more about userpages here, and if you want to create one, just click on your name (in red) that you see at the top centre of your screen. 

To create a new article in the main body of the encyclopedia, either click on a red link in an existing article or list, or put the name of the topic into the """"search"""" box at the left-hand side of the screen and click """"go"""". 

And again, if I can be of any help, please let me know on my talk page.   

 Various stuff 

Hi again - you're really getting the hang of things now. I'll continue to offer some unsolicited advice - if I'm bombarding you too much, please feel free to tell me to get lost! )

I took the liberty of moving your """"under construction"""" article from your userpage to User:Petebutt/Sandbox, which is the conventional spot to store such things.

A few notes from your recent contributions - these are all really formatting """"nits"""" (with perhaps the exception of the links) - please take them in a spirit of friendly encouragement and as a """"fast track"""" towards learning Wikipedia (and WikiProject Aircraft) style.

SectionsIn many articles, you'll see """"hidden"""" comments like . These have been left as reminders that if the article ever grows big enough to require splitting into sections, these are the conventional names for these sections (take a look at a major article like F-4 Phantom II as an example, and WikiProject Aircraft: Page content for the guide)
 the section will not become visible until the """""""" are removed
 in short articles, there's no advantage to using these; it's better to just leave them hidden - remember that we're trying to write encyclopedia articles in connected prose. One-sentence paragraphs (let alone sections) have little value here
 For experimental, one-off prototypes, the """"Operators"""" and """"operational history"""" sections are meaningless - just leave them out.

ContextYou removed context-giving introductions from a couple of articles. It's extremely important that articles establish context right at the beginning. There are a number of different ways that readers may come across an article; therefore the lead should establish straight away the what-where-when, and that for example, the """"Yakovlev Yak-25 was a prototype fighter aircraft built in the Soviet Union in 1947"""". Elaboration can (and should!) follow - but straight away, the reader knows what this article is about, and that this is not a car, washing machine, or something from Star Trek.

In response to Bduke's question 2 above, I think that it has become very difficult on wikipedia to say anything general about Guiding and Girl Scouting because someone will always point out that some Guides are boys. This is a fair point, but I think it has become overdone. If you take a look at the WAGGGS website, it's all about girls. Not girls and a few boys. They say of themselves """"The World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts is a worldwide Movement providing non-formal education where girls and young women develop leadership and life skills through self-development, challenge and adventure."""" Their catchphrase starts """"Girls worldwide say..."""" WAGGGS has not felt it necessary to change its name. This is not because they don't realise some WAGGGS member organisations take boys, it's because taking boys is an anomaly, not the norm. It's an anomaly we shouldn't ignore, but nor should we get too wrapped up in it.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0
