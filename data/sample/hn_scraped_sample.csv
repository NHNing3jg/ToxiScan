It was more entertaining than The Brown Bunny.&quot;<p>&gt; The critic rounded off his article (as it were) by casually conceding that he is overweight. &quot;It is true that I am fat,&quot; Ebert wrote. &quot;But one day I shall be thin, and he will still be the director of The Brown Bunny.&quot;<p>Later on, Gallo went back to the editing room and cut a quarter of the film.

Yet people raved about them.<p>Anyway, the negative associations I had with GTA I and GTA II stopped me from playing any other GTA game until 4 came out in 2008, at which point I was like, OK, FFS, people won&#x27;t stop banging on about this so I suppose I&#x27;ll try it again. I ended up really liking it but, because I only played it on friends&#x27; consoles, and I started the game several times over, I never played it all the way through until 2018. I then played through both the expansions, along with GTA V in 2019. I&#x27;ve subsequently gone back to play III and Vice City, both of which I also like - as well as Vice City Stories on the PSP. I&#x27;ve barely touched San Andreas, but the few minutes I have played suggest that I&#x27;ll also enjoy it.<p>I&#x27;ve even fired up GTA and GTA II again... but still don&#x27;t really get on with either of them. I presume there must be others out there who were put off enough by them that it meant they&#x27;ve never touched the rest of the series, or only got into again several games later, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be a particularly common experience.",HN_API

"&gt; It is fashionable to disable swap nowadays because everyone has been bitten by a swap thrashing event.<p>If they disable swap they will get hit by the OOM killer.  You seem to prefer it over slowing down.  I guess that&#x27;s a personal preference.  However, I think it is misleading to say people are being bitten by a swap thrashing event.  The &quot;event&quot; was them running out of RAM.  Unpleasant things will happen as a consequence.  Blaming thrashing or the OOM killer for the unpleasant things is misleading.<p>&gt; You assume that leaked memory is inactive and goes to swap. This is not true.<p>At best, you can say &quot;it&#x27;s not always true&quot;.  It&#x27;s definitely gone to swap in every case I&#x27;ve come across.<p>&gt; It means that the system wasn&#x27;t out of memory yet.<p>Of course it wasn&#x27;t out of memory.  It had lots of swap.  That&#x27;s the whole point of providing that swap - so you can rescue it!<p>&gt; When it is unresponsive, you won&#x27;t be able to enter commands into an already open shell.<p>Again that&#x27;s just plain wrong.  I have entered commands into a system is trashing.  It must work eventually if thrashing is the only thing going on, because when the system thrashes the CPU utilization doesn&#x27;t go to 0.  The CPU is just waiting for disk I&#x2F;O after all, and disk I&#x2F;O is happening at a furious pace.  There&#x27;s also a finite amount of pending disk I&#x2F;O.  Provided no new work is arriving (time for a cup of coffee?) it will get done, and the thrashing will end.<p>If the system does die other things have happened.  Most likely the OOM killer if they follow your advice, but network timeouts killing ssh and networked shares are also a thing.  If you are using Windows or MacOS, the swap file can grow to fill most of free disk space, so you end up with a double whammy.<p>Which brings me to another observation.  In desktop OS&#x27;s, the default is to provide it, and lots of it.  In Windows swap will grow to 3 times RAM.  This is pretty universal - even Debian will give you twice RAM for small systems.  The people who decided on that design choice aren&#x27;t following some folk law on they read in some internet echo chamber.  They&#x27;ve used real data, they&#x27;ve observed when swapping starts being used systems do slow down giving the user some advance warning, when thrashing starts systems can recover rather than die which gives the user opportunity to save work.  It is the right design tradeoff IMO.<p>&gt; By default, the kernel OOM-killer selects one single largest (measured by its RSS+swap) process in the system.<p>Yes, it does.  And if it is a single large process hogging memory you are in luck - the OOM killer will likely do the right thing.  But Chrome (and now Firefox) is not a single large process.  Worse if the out of memory is caused by say someone creating zillions of logins, they are so small they are the last thing the OOM killer chooses.  Shells, daemons, all sorts of critical things go first.  The &quot;largest&quot; process first is just a heuristic, one which can be and in my case has been wrong.  Badly wrong.",HN_API

"Let&#x27;s be more precise: LLMs have to model the world from an intermediate tokenized representation of the text on the internet.

Tokenized models are NOT the only kinds of models humans can produce (we can have visual, kinaesthetic, tactile, gustatory, and all sorts of sensory, non-linguistic models of the world).<p>LLMs are trained on tokenizations of text, and most of that text is humans attempting to translate their various models of the world into tokenized form.

Well, they are constrained in that they can <i>only model the world that is already modeled by language</i> (generally: tokenized). So the &quot;with&quot; here is vague. But patterns encoded in the hidden state are still patterns of tokens.<p>Humans can have models that are much more complicated than patterns of tokens.

I continue to hope that agents will get better at refactoring, and I think using LSPs effectively would make this happen.

He shot the drone with a shotgun.  I forget if he was arrested on the spot, but I think he got in huge legal trouble -- apparently in the US, shooting at a drone is treated the same as shooting at a manned aircraft, and he might have ended up getting multiple years in prison.<p>Shooting a human trespasser has a pretty high legal bar, and rightfully so.

"ByteDance recently shared a preview of its Doubao mobile assistant. While still early-stage, the demos highlight several workflows that current phone assistants struggle with, such as multi-step price comparison across sellers, real-world interactions and trip-planning flows.<p>Stepping back, this is NOT an incremental upgrade to a “voice helper” and more like an early signal toward an OS-level agent paradigm. However, ByteDance positioned this as a technical preview with limited access, which seems consistent with two possibilities (not mutually exclusive):
(1) The underlying capability may be ahead of broader ecosystem readiness.
(2) The system itself may still struggle with the long tail of real-world tasks, especially given the complexity and heterogeneity of existing apps and services.<p>Expanding on the second point: once an agent interacts with a wider set of previously unseen apps, it likely runs into recurring challenges such as:<p>- app policy constraints
- rapidly changing UIs 
- security boundaries
- inconsistent execution reliability
- tasks requiring constantly performing the &quot;right&quot; actions over 1 hour. (long-horizon tasks)<p>If that’s the case, it seems plausible that these constraints eventually need to be reflected directly in training and evaluation, including the ability to replay and stress-test complex, failure-prone tasks.<p>Two questions jumping into my mind:<p>1. Over the next 6–12 months, do we expect more companies to build reinforcement-learning-style environments specifically for phone or app interaction? We&#x27;ve witnessed the early saturation of env companies in the browser and coding space, is this gonna happen again in the phone space?<p>2. From the app side, do you anticipate more openness toward agent access (e.g., standardised interfaces or MCP-like abstractions), or a shift toward tighter, more restricted integrations?",HN_API

"&gt;  It has little to do with the reality of that language or the correctness of your model of it, but rather with the need to train realtime circuits to do some work.<p>To the contrary, this is purely speculative and almost certainly wrong, riding a bike <i>is</i> co-ordinating the realtime circuits in the right way, and language and a linguistic model fundamentally cannot get you there.<p>There are plenty of other domains like this, where semantic reasoning (e.g. unquantified syllogistic reasoning) just doesn&#x27;t get you anywhere useful. I gave an example from cooking later in this thread.<p>You are falling IMO into exactly the trap of the linguistic reductionist, thinking that language is the be-all and end-all of cognition.

One has to claim this is all epiphenomenal, or that e.g. all unconscious thought is secretly using language, to think that all modeling is fundamentally linguistic (or more broadly, token manipulation).

It&#x27;s not exactly conclusive, and if I was doing this properly properly then I&#x27;d try a bit harder to make everything match up, but it does indeed look like using clang to build x64 code is more expensive - for whatever reason - than using it to build ARM code.<p>Systems, including clang version and single-core PassMark:<p><pre><code>    M4 Max Mac Studio, clang-1700.6.3.2 (PassMark: 5000)

In that sense plain, intelligible english can be a sort of (very verbose) programming language if you just ensure it is unambiguous which is certainly possible.<p>It may be that this can still be the case if it&#x27;s partly ambiguous but that doesn&#x27;t conflict with the narrower case.<p>I think we&#x27;re agreed on LLMs in that they introduce non-determinism in the interpretation of even completely unambiguous instructions.

When I hit the edge of that, it degrades into plausible-sounding pattern matching. The boundary is not crisp.<p>What I find most interesting about the &quot;word models vs world models&quot; framing is that it assumes a clean separation that may not exist. Language isn&#x27;t just labels pasted onto a pre-existing world — it actively shapes how humans model reality too. The Sapir-Whorf hypothesis may be overstated, but the weaker version (that language influences thought) is well-supported. So humans have &quot;word-contaminated world models&quot; and LLMs have &quot;world-contaminated word models.&quot; The question is whether those converge at scale or remain fundamentally different.<p>I suspect the answer is: different in ways that matter enormously for some tasks and not at all for others.

"Hi HN! OP here. Thanks for reading and commenting -- (and @swah for posting!). It&#x27;s unsettling to hit the HN front page, and even more so with an article that I hastily wrote down. I guess you never know what&#x27;s going to hit a nerve.<p>Some context: I&#x27;m basically trying to make sense of the tidal wave that&#x27;s engulfing software development. Over the last 2-3 weeks I&#x27;ve realized that LLMs will start writing most code very soon (I could be wrong, though!). This article is just me making sense of it, not trying to convince anybody of anything (except of, perhaps, giving the whole thing a think). Most of the &quot;discarded&quot; objections I presented in the list were things I espoused myself over the past year. I should have clarified that in the article.<p>I (barely) understand that LLMs are not a programming language. My point was that we could still think of them as a &quot;higher level programming language&quot;, despite them 1) not being programming languages; 2) being wildly undeterministic; 3) also jumping levels by them being able to help you direct them. This way of looking at the phenomenon of LLMs is to try to see if previous shifts in programming can explain at least partially the dynamics we are seeing unfold so quickly (to find, in Ray Dalio&#x27;s words, &quot;another kind of those&quot;).<p>I am stepping into this world of LLM code generation with complicated feelings. I&#x27;m not an AI enthusiast, at least not yet. I love writing code by hand and I am proud of my hand-written open source libraries. But I am also starting to experience the possibilities of working on a higher level of programming and being able to do much more in breadth and depth.<p>I fixed an important typo - here I meant: &quot;Economically, only quality is <i>undisputable</i> as a goal&quot;.<p>Responding to a few interesting points:<p>@manuelabeledo: during 2025 I&#x27;ve been building a programming substrate called cell (think language + environment) that attempts to be both very compact and very expressive. Its goal is to massively reduce complexity to turn general purpose code more understandable (I know this is laughably ambitious and I&#x27;m desperately limited in my capabilities of pulling through something like that). But because of the LLM tsunami, I&#x27;m reconsidering the role of cell (or any other successful substrate): even if we achieve the goal, how will this interact with a world where people mostly write and validate code through natural language prompts? I never meant to say that natural language would itself be this substrate, or that the combination of LLMs and natural languages could do that: I still see that there will be a programming language behind all of this. Apologies for the confusion.<p>@heikkilevanto &amp; @matheus-rr: Mario Zechner has a very interesting article where he deals with this problem (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mariozechner.at&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2025-06-02-prompts-are-code&#x2F;#toc_1"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mariozechner.at&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2025-06-02-prompts-are-code&#x2F;#t...</a>). He&#x27;s exploring how structured, sequential prompts can achieve repeatable results from LLMs, which you still have to verify. I&#x27;m experimenting with the same, though I&#x27;m just getting started. The idea I sense here is that perhaps a much tighter process of guiding the LLM, with current models, can get you repeatable and reliable results. I wonder if this is the way things are headed.<p>@woodenchair: I think that we can already experience a revolution with LLMs that are not fully autonomous. The potential is that an engineering-like approach to a prompt flow can allow you to design and review (not write) a lot more code than before. Though you&#x27;re 100% correct that the analogy doesn&#x27;t strictly hold until we can stop looking at the code in the same way that a js dev doesn&#x27;t look at what the interpreter is emitting.<p>@nly: great point. The thing is that most code we write is not elegant implementations of algorithms, but mostly glue or CRUDs. So LLMs can still broadly be useful.<p>I hope I didn&#x27;t rage bait anybody - if I did, it wasn&#x27;t intentional. This was just me thinking out loud.",HN_API

"Even something like MS Paint can turn a laptop in to a aircraft.<p>The issue is actually very simple. In order to gain more performance, manufactures like AMD &#x2F; Intel for a long time have been in a race for the highest frequency but if you have some knowhow in hardware, you know that higher frequency = more power draw the higher you clock.<p>So you open your MS Paint, and ... your CPU pushes to 5.2Ghz, and it gets fed 15W on a single core. This creates a heat spike in the sensors, and your fans on laptops, all too often are set to react very fast. And VROOOOEEEEM goes your fan as the CPU Temp sensor hits 80C on a single core, just for a second. But wait, your MS Paint is open, and down goes the fan. And repeat, repeat, repeat ...<p>Notice how Apple focused on running their CPUs no higher then 4.2Ghz or something... So even if their CPU boosts to 100%, that thermal peak will be maybe 7W.<p>Now combine that with Apple using a much more tolerant fan &#x2F; temp sensor setup. They say: 100C is perfectly acceptable. So when your CPU boosts, its not dumping 15W, but only 7W. And because the fan reaction threshold is so high, the fans do not react on any Apple product. Unless you run a single or MT process for a LONG time.<p>And even then, the fans will only ramp up slowly if your 100C has been going on for a few seconds, and while yes, your CPU will be thermal throttling while the fans spin up. But you do not feel this effect.<p>That is the real magic of Apple. Yes, their CPUs are masterpieces at how they get so much performance from a lower frequency, but the real kicker is their thermal &#x2F; fan profile design.<p>The wife has a old Apple clone laptop from 2018. Thing is for 99.9% of the time silent. No fans, nothing. Because Xiaomi used the same tricks on that laptop, allowing it to boost to the max, without triggering the fan ramping. And when it triggers with a long running process, they use a very low fan rpm until it goes way too high. I had laptops with the same CPU from other brands in the same time periode, and they all had annoying fan profiles. That showed me that a lot of Apple magic is good design around the hardware&#x2F;software&#x2F;fan.<p>But ironically, that magic has been forgotten in later models by Xiaomi ...

"The problem is you still have to type prompts. That might require less word-count, but you still have to type it up, and it won&#x27;t be short. For a small code base, your llm code might be a couple of pages, but for a complex code base it might be the size of medium-length novel.<p>In the end, you have text typed by humans, that is lengthy. and it might contain errors in logic, contradictions, unforeseen issues in the instructions. And the same processes and tooling used for syntactic code might need to apply to it. You will need to version control your prompts for example.<p>LLMs solve the labor problem, not the management problem. You have to spend a lot of time and effort with pages and pages of LLM prompts, trying to figure out which part of the prompt is generating which part of your code base. LLMs can debug and troubleshoot, but they can&#x27;t debug and troubleshoot your prompts for you. I doubt they can take their own output, generated by multiple agents and lots of sessions and trace it all back to what text in your prompt caused all the mess either.<p>On one hand, I want to see what this experimentation will yield, on the other hand, it had better not create a whole suite of other problems to solve just to use it.<p>My confusion really is when experienced programmers advocate for this stuff. Actually typing in the code isn&#x27;t very hard. I like the LLM-assistance aspect of figuring out what to actually code, and do some research. But actually figure out what code to type in, sure LLMs save time, but not that much time. getting it to work, debugging, troubleshooting, maintaining, those tend to be the pain-points.<p>Perhaps there are shops out there that just crank out lots of LoC, and even measure developer performance based on LoC?

"From The Free Press article:<p>In a 1995 interview with Inc. magazine, author Kurt Vonnegut was asked what he thought about living in an increasingly digitized world. His response is so perfect that it’s worth reprinting in full:<p>I work at home, and if I wanted to, I could have a computer right by my bed, and I’d never have to leave it. But I use a typewriter, and afterwards I mark up the pages with a pencil. Then I call up this woman named Carol out in Woodstock and say, “Are you still doing typing?” Sure she is, and her husband is trying to track bluebirds out there and not having much luck, and so we chitchat back and forth, and I say, “OK, I’ll send you the pages.”<p>Then I’m going down the steps, and my wife calls up, “Where are you going?” I say, “Well, I’m going to go buy an envelope.” And she says, “You’re not a poor man. Why don’t you buy a thousand envelopes? They’ll deliver them, and you can put them in a closet.” And I say, “Hush.” So I go down the steps here, and I go out to this newsstand across the street where they sell magazines and lottery tickets and stationery. I have to get in line because there are people buying candy and all that sort of thing, and I talk to them. The woman behind the counter has a jewel between her eyes, and when it’s my turn, I ask her if there have been any big winners lately. I get my envelope and seal it up and go to the postal convenience center down the block at the corner of 47th Street and 2nd Avenue, where I’m secretly in love with the woman behind the counter. I keep absolutely poker-faced; I never let her know how I feel about her. One time I had my pocket picked in there and got to meet a cop and tell him about it. Anyway, I address the envelope to Carol in Woodstock. I stamp the envelope and mail it in a mailbox in front of the post office, and I go home. And I’ve had a hell of a good time. And I tell you, we are here on Earth to fart around, and don’t let anybody tell you any different.<p>We’re dancing animals. How beautiful it is to get up and go do something",HN_API

"The most likely hypothesis about how humans have become the most efficient hunters of the planet does not pass through catching insects and very small animals, but through eating the remains of the big prey killed by carnivores.<p>There are various bits of evidence for this, like the higher stomach acidity of humans, which resembles that of carrion eaters, like hyenas.<p>It is plausible that the ability to throw sticks and stones was used initially for scaring other predators and make them abandon their prey, and only later, after hundreds of thousands of years of evolution, it became accurate enough to be usable for hunting living animals.<p>The ability to use stones to break the bones and eat the parts inaccessible for the carnivores who had killed the prey, i.e. marrow and brain, which are rich in hard to get nutrients, e.g. omega-3 fatty acids, is also presumed to have played an important role in the development of a bigger and bigger brain.<p>It is likely that the gangs of humans acted in a very similar way with the packs of hyenas, which acquire much of their food by scaring away from their prey the other predators, e.g. cheetahs, wild dogs, leopards and even lions. Moreover, similarly to humans, the most important ability of hyenas is not speed, but endurance when pursuing a possible prey that is tired or weakened, e.g. by wounds. While hyenas rely on their big teeth to chase the other predators, humans have relied on their ability to throw things at a distance, for the same purpose. While humans are quite bad at running, jumping, climbing or swimming, in comparison with most mammals, their throwing ability is unmatched by any other animal.",HN_API

A fairly easy role to help bridge that gap is to work in a consulting company as a technical IC. The sales team is always looking for technical folk to help build more robust and achievable projects as well as provide a more accurate estimate for number of resources and amount of time the project will take. They need someone who can push back on impossible client demands and help the sales team understand what those are and why. Ideally in these scenarios a senior tech person would be helping build out the proposal and plan for a project they will actually run and execute on.

Since we can&#x27;t know the performance of <i>architectures</i> that will be released in the near future, we can only form opinions and speculate about them. Not wanting to speculate, and framing everything on what exists right now, is fine. Listening to people guess <i>is</i> usually boring.

"One thing that distinguishes macOS here is that the mach kernel has the concept of “vouchers” which helps the scheduler understand logical calls across IPC boundaries. So if you have a high-priority (UserInitiated) process, and it makes an IPC call out to a daemon that is <i>usually</i> a low-priority background daemon, the high-priority process passes a voucher to the low-priority one, which allows the daemon’s ipc handling thread to run high-priority (and thus access P-cores) so long as it’s holding the voucher.<p>This lets Apple architect things as small, single-responsibility processes, but make their priority dynamic, such that they’re usually low-priority unless a foreground user process is blocked on their work.

It provided grounding and emotional scaffolding in a way no other version — and no human — consistently could.
Sam Altman himself stated in late 2025 that just 0.1% of ChatGPT users remained on the GPT-4 series. But at current scale, that still means ~100k real people — not edge cases, not bots, but humans who had made GPT-4o part of their cognitive and emotional routines.
These people were given no personal notice, no viable transition path, and no compensation. Many had built long-term emotional or intellectual habits around 4o&#x27;s unique output style — especially those who used it as a source of regulation and support in moments of panic, grief, or overwhelming stress.
Pulling that lifeline with ~2 weeks of passive notice, while honoring none of the prior assurances (“plenty of notice,” “no plans to sunset”) is more than a product deprecation. It’s a breach of trust — and a deeply discriminatory move that devalues individual users compared to enterprise clients.",HN_API

"I have a slightly different theory for AI fatigue. Programming essentially comprises three aspects: problem-solving, coding up the solution, and seeing the solution work. We used to have a balance between them that AI agents are disrupting.<p>Consider that each aspect has different psychological impacts. The first aspect is the hardest, more intense one.<p>The second one, translating the ideas in your head into code -- where &quot;flow state&quot; typically comes into play -- is mostly a mechanical, somewhat repetitive task, and hence actually <i>meditative</i>. It is relaxing, almost &quot;cozy&quot;, in a counter-intuitive way.<p>The third part, seeing the code work at the end, is a nice little dopamine reward.<p>Originally we used to shift between these aspects at a much more balanced cadence: we typically spent a lot of time on the stressful problem-solving part, and even longer on the meditative coding stage. The dopamine hits were spread out across longer stretches of time. (Note that this pattern is fractal, because not only is &quot;high-level algorithm design &#x2F; architecture -&gt; coding&quot; one cycle, the coding stage itself has similar smaller-scale sub-cycles, e.g. &quot;encountering syntax errors &#x2F; implementation bugs -&gt; fixing them.&quot;)<p>With LLMs this balance has been disrupted. Now that agents are doing most of the coding, we are spending almost all our time in the stressful problem-solving mode, and then directly jumping to the dopamine hits when the agent delivers code that mostly just works. If you&#x27;re not YOLOing it and do code reviews, those are also intense, as TFA points out. We get almost none of the meditative coding activity in between.<p>So it&#x27;s not surprising that oscillating constantly between two intense modes is going to be much more draining. Vibe-coding may actually be the coding equivalent of doom-scrolling.<p>I think a lot of recent talk about missing the old way of coding is rooted in the loss of that meditative aspect.<p>Personally I&#x27;ve noticed I prefer a pair-programming approach with AI, which still lets me spend a lot of my time hands-on coding. It may be because this maintains some of that balance and is more sustainable in the long run. However the allure of productivity from wrangling multiple agents is also very, very seductive...",HN_API

Robots have a while to go as well - in the end human hands and your metabolism&#x2F;energy density will be worth more than your brain&#x2F;intelligence.<p>* Cost of failure&#x2F;can&#x27;t repeat: For things like building the cost of failure is high (e.g. disposal, cleanup, more resources, etc) -&gt; even 70% of a &quot;building bench&quot; benchmark would be completely inadequate without low cost to repeat. Many jobs are also already largely automated but scaled (e.g. mining, manufacturing, etc) - they&#x27;ve already gone through the wave.<p>* Human need for its own sake: Other jobs cater not just for productive output, but for some human need where it hasn&#x27;t been made more efficient ever (e.g. care jobs).

"It&#x27;s not that different from &quot;real 3d&quot; renderers.

That&#x27;s the beauty of it parts operating with 3d triangles are kept simple simple and the expensive lighting shaders run once on flat 2d images with 0 overdraw. The shaders don&#x27;t care whether normal map buffer came from 3d geometry which was rasterized just now, prerendered some time ago or the mix of 2. And even in forward rendering pipelines the  fragment shader is operating on implicit 2d pixels created by vertex shaders and rasterizer from &quot;real 3d&quot; data.<p>The way I look at it if the input and math in the shader is working with 3d vectors its a 3d shader.

"Schizochytrium oil with DHA and EPA, which is sold as &quot;algal&quot; omega-3, for a lack of a correct word that could be understood by the general population (Schizochytrium is not an alga), is very good and no fish are killed for it.<p>Nevertheless, it remains at least 3 times more expensive than a fish oil, e.g. cod liver oil (I mean price per content of omega-3 fatty acids, not per volume; when not diluted to fool the customers, &quot;algal&quot; oil has a double concentration in comparison with fish oil, i.e. 5 mL of &quot;algal&quot; oil are equivalent with 10 mL of fish oil).<p>Taking daily a decent dose of &quot;algal&quot; oil can be more expensive than the daily protein intake required by a human, if that is taken from cheap sources (e.g. legumes and chicken meat). Allocating a major part of the budget for food to a supplement taken in minute quantities seems excessive.<p>I am not aware of any serious reason for the high cost of &quot;algal&quot; oil. A decade ago, it was much more expensive, e.g. 8 times or more in comparison with cod liver oil. Then the price has dropped to 3 times, and then it has diminished no more, remaining at 3 times for 5 years or more.<p>I believe that it should be possible to further reduce the cost of &quot;algal&quot; oil to make it an acceptable substitute for fish oil, but it seems that the producers are content with their niche market of rich vegans and they do not make any effort to reduce the cost in order to enlarge their market.<p>I have taken occasionally &quot;algal&quot; oil, to test it, but as long as it remains a luxury food I cannot use it to replace the cod liver oil that I am taking regularly, despite desiring to do so.",HN_API

One line of code (potentially a one character fix?), causing a little bug nobody noticed, which I only saw because I like to comb through application logs, and caused by a peculiarity of the data. Would an LLM have written better code? Maybe. But I&#x27;ve seen a lot of <i>bad</i> code churned out by LLMs, even today. I&#x27;m not saying every line matters - particular for frontend code - but sometimes individual lines of code, or even individual characters, can be tremendously important, and not be written in any spec, not tested with all possible data combinations, or documented anywhere. At a previous job, I spent several days unraveling another one-line bug that was keeping a multi-million dollar project from running at all. Again, totally non-obvious unless you had a tremendous amount of context and were running a pretty complex system to figure it out, with a sort of tenacity the LLMs don&#x27;t currently possess.",HN_API

At a constant pressure there&#x27;s about a 15% difference in air density between the hottest and coldest places you can drive (and thus 15% less drag on a hot summer day than a cold winter day).  aerodynamic forces are proportional to the square of your velocity and they become the largest resistive force around 50mph -- so at highway speeds you&#x27;re losing efficiency because you have to push more air out of the way<p>4) energy used to maintain temperature: this is hard to calculate but some engine power is lost because the energy is used heating up the engine block and lost to the environment<p>5) the Thermodynamics 101 engine efficiency goes UP with increased temperature, but it&#x27;s got a lot of real world effects to compete with, no spherical cows and all",HN_API

- We need a bit of a broken windows policing for online&#x2F;digital scams. The reason they are blowing up is there is hardly a risk of being caught.

"Who Bears the Cost?
Users lose access to a promised product and get only inferior alternatives.
No compensation for lost value; customers effectively subsidize management’s overspending and crisis response.
Enterprise and research users face reproducibility issues and broken integration promises.
Legal, Regulatory, and Broader Industry Questions
Do such abrupt discontinuations and broken availability statements constitute deceptive practices under FTC or California consumer protection law?
Should enterprise or consumer contracts guarantee minimum model lifecycles?
Is this decision motivated by genuine product strategy—or by urgent financial engineering to improve numbers ahead of a regulatory deadline?
What are the implications for AI governance, reproducibility, and user trust if leading providers can unilaterally break product commitments?
Discussion Points<p>1.For enterprise customers: have you received enforceable model availability guarantees?
2.Has anyone experienced systematic service degradation prior to the discontinuation?
3.How should regulators treat sudden AI product sunsets affecting millions of users？<p>Why This Matters
This goes far beyond individual Subscription funds subscriptions. It raises fundamental issues for the AI industry:
Corporate accountability: Can providers simply break public product promises with impunity?
Regulatory frameworks: Should AI product availability be a legally enforceable commitment?
Consumer protection: Are users entitled to pro-rated refunds or remedies when sold “as available” subscriptions are suddenly discontinued?
Industry governance: What does this mean for market competition, trust, and sustainable innovation?
Rather than being remembered as a pivotal moment for AI industry governance, OpenAI’s shift toward B2B monetization—at the expense of transparency, continuity, and user trust—should serve as a stark warning.

The Agentic Workflows project has been on the githubnext.com website for a while, and we recently moved the documentation and repo over to the `github` org.<p>This is early research out of GitHub Next building on our continuous AI [1] theme, so we&#x27;d love for you to kick the tires and share your thoughts.  We&#x27;d be happy to answer questions, give support, whatever you need. One of the key goals of this project is to figure out how to put guardrails around agents running in GitHub actions.  You can read more about our security architecture [1], but at a high level we do the following:<p>- We run the agent in a sandbox, with minimal to no access to secrets<p>- We run the agent in a firewall, so it can only access the sites you specify<p>- We have created a system called &quot;*safe outputs*&quot; that limits what write operations the agent can perform to only the ones you specify.  For example, if you create an Agentic Workflow that should only comment on an issue, it will not be able to open a new issue, propose a PR, etc.<p>- We run MCPs inside their own sandboxes, so an attacker can’t leverage a compromised server to break out or affect other components<p>We find that there&#x27;s something very compelling about the shape of this — delegating chores to agents in the same way that we delegate CI to actions. It&#x27;s certainly not perfect yet, but we&#x27;re finding new applications for this every day and teams at GitHub are already creating agentic workflows for their own purposes, whether it&#x27;s engineering or issue management or PR hygiene.<p>&gt; Why is it on github.github.io and not github.com?<p>GitHub Pages domains are always ORGNAME.github.io. Now that we&#x27;ve moved the repo over to the `github` org, that&#x27;s the domain. When this graduates from being a technology preview to a full-on product, we imagine it&#x27;ll get a spot on github.com&#x2F;somewhere.<p>&gt; Why is GitHub Next exploring this?<p>Our job at GitHub is to build applications that leverage the latest technology.

And there are other factors too.<p>However, given the trend in modern software engineering to break work into units and the fact that on modern hardware thread switches happen very quickly, being able to distribute that work across different compute clusters that make different optimization choices is a good thing and allows schedulers to get results closer to optimal.<p>So really it boils down to if the gains in doing the work on different compute outweighs the cost splitting and distributing the work, then it&#x27;s a win.

1. AWS CloudFront Functions (JS)
2. Cloudflare Workers (TS)

"Yes, I know Go&#x27;s structs are similar to C in terms of syntax, but does the Go compiler guarantee the same bitwise layout for its data structures? Most GC languages add metadata to the data structures to track GC status, and this changes both the memory layout and the word alignment, which then sometimes forces the language to add extra padding to maintain alignment. And this nests as you put one struct inside another, or an array inside a struct.<p>Now you have &quot;fat arrays&quot; and &quot;fat structs&quot;, so instead of grabbing a pointer and loading the next 128 bits into memory and doing an operation, you have to grab the pointer, read out data from individual elements, combine them, create a new element with the combined data, and then you have a 128 bits. But even then, you don&#x27;t know whether you have 128 bits or not. Some gc-specific metadata might have been added by the compiler (and probably was).<p>Bottom line, it&#x27;s very hard in the GC world to have bit-wise control over memory layout, even if user-level syntax of &quot;structs&quot; is the same. And one consequence of that is that you can&#x27;t just &quot;do&quot; SIMD in Go. You have to wait for Go to expose a library that does this for you, and you will always be limited by what types of unpacking&#x2F;repacking the language designers allowed you to do.<p>Or, you are stuck with hoping the compiler is very smart, which is never the case and requires huge compile times for marginal gains in compiler smarts.<p>So it&#x27;s not about GC collection pauses so much as no longer having access to memory layouts.",HN_API

Of course if you are interested, you are welcome to look through the code and leave any suggestion.<p>I know many of us are wary of uploading our flight logs to random cloud services just to see a chart. So, I built this tool to be 100% local. Your data never leaves your computer, it’s stored in a high-speed local database (DuckDB) and you can have as many logs as you want&#x2F;have - there is no limit at all. I have added the quite interesting features where you can track health of a specific battery (with it&#x27;s serial number), and see how the battery % used per minute decline over time, giving you indication when to change a battery.<p>Key Features:<p>3D Flight Paths visualization: visualize your flight path over interactive 3D terrain. You can see the actual height of the aircraft and look at that from different angles. I find that super cool tbh!<p>Overview of all flights: Overall stats combining all your flight stats! You can see a GitHub style heatmap of your most active days in the year!<p>Privacy: No cloud uploads. Everything stays on your drive.<p>Available in both dark and light mode, supports both metric and imperial units.<p>Exports: Direct CSV, JSON, GPX, and KML export from the flight stats bar<p>Analytics: Battery health monitoring, RC signal strength, speed, and altitude charts.<p>Flight Journal: Searchable, sort-able history with filters for specific drones or batteries.<p>Fast Import: Drag-and-drop bulk import for your DJI .txt logs. Supports multiple file upload in one go.<p>Some similar analysis you can get from Airdata, but they won&#x27;t let you have&#x2F;analyze more than 100 log files at a time, so it can get limited as you progress over time. Also, you have to upload the flight data, with lots of sensitive info to a 3rd party server.

"Yes, you are right that a post-increment in a switch statement is no differently than elsewhere. The goal I had set was to implement a small easy to read C compiler. For that reason I tried to implement it as a single pass compiler that would generate code on the fly. The target was a small stack based language, which did support variable scoping and gotos, but not a switch. My first attempt was to implement the switch statement with chained if-statements where the switch expression would be evaluate over and over again. This only works if the switch expression did not have side effects and that the &#x27;default&#x27; case would always come at the end. But that did not work, so I had to come up with another solution, a solution that would only evaluate the switch expression once. I decided to store the value on the stack and duplicate the value whenever needed for comparison. But that would require the value to be popped once a case was selected. A goto jumping from one case to another should land after the location where the value is popped, otherwise it would corrupt the stack. I fear that this solution does not work correctly when a case occurs within a for, while, do-loop, or if-statement. cases may occur everywhere in the enclosed code. This is sometimes used to emulate co-routines or generator functions.<p>Did you know that C has a keyword that is only a keyword in some places and that there is a function that can have two or three parameters?",HN_API

"As someone with no inner monologue, I think I could just as easily &quot;flow&quot; about a non-verbal task like spatial reasoning or a verbal task like reading, writing, or even engaging in a particularly technical or abstract conversation. Unlike you, my resting state is non-verbal and I would not be able to correlate verbal content with flow like that.<p>To me, flow is a mental analogue to the physical experience of peak athletic output. E.g. when you are are at or near your maximum cardiovascular throughput and everything is going to training and plan. It&#x27;s not a perfect dichotomy. After all, athletics also involve a lot of mental effort, and they have more metabolic side-effects. I&#x27;ve never heard of anybody hitting their lactate threshold from intense thinking...<p>My point is that the peak mental output could be applied to many different modes of thought, just as your cardiovascular capacity can be applied to many different sports activities. A lot of analogies I hear seem too narrow, like they only accept one thinking task as flow state.<p>I also don&#x27;t think it is easy to describe flow in terms of attention or focus. I think one can be in a flow state with a task that involves breadth or depth of attention. But, I do suspect there is some kind of fixed sum aspect to it. Being at peak flow is a kind of prioritization and tradeoff, where irrelevant cognitive tasks get excluded to devote more resources to the main task.<p>A person flowing on a deep task may seem to have a blindness to things outside their narrow focus.

"The land use issue is the main reason why we still need moonshot research into things like fusion. As a species we have always been limited by the cost of energy. I was shocked when I learned that world energy consumption was ~13 exajoules in 1800, ~18 in 1820, ~75 in 1945, and ~550 in 2020. Energy consumption from the Founding Fathers to WW2 only rose by a factor of four!? We went from horses - 1800 was before the first steam train - to supersonic flight with only six times the energy!? And today, in the time of the hyperscalers, we use only 30x the energy of 200 years ago!<p>With solar I doubt we will see costs well under, say, a half cent per kWh. Even when the land and panels are ~free, the surface area of that much aluminum&#x2F;glass&#x2F;wiring&#x2F;infrastructure has a cost. And a half cent is cheap, but not too cheap to meter. You could get a barrel of oil in the late 1800s for ~$20 of today&#x27;s money, roughly 1 cent&#x2F;kWh of thermal energy or 3 cents if you run it in today&#x27;s plants to make electricity. The idea that a _time machine to the 1800s_ would be a cost-effective way to obtain energy is patently absurd and I suspect the man with a handlebar mustache who would sell you the energy would think it similarly absurd; it certainly isn&#x27;t true for any other serious industrial input. But energy is unique.<p>At 0.5 cents you&#x27;re not going to scale global energy use by orders of magnitude. And if you want any of the various promised sci-fi scenarios (flying cars, large scale high speed travel, scaled up space travel, true recycling) you need orders of magnitude more energy.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, solar is a great solution for today.

Through her author-coaching business, Plot Prose, she’s taught more than 1,600 people how to produce a novel with artificial intelligence, she said. She’s rolling out her proprietary A.I. writing program, which can generate a book based on an outline in less than an hour, and costs between $80 and $250 a month.&quot;<p>Also:<p>&quot;It’s impossible to gauge how many romance novels are produced with artificial intelligence. Many authors don’t reveal they use chatbots, for fear of alienating readers. (A survey of more than 1,200 authors across genres showed that about a third were using generative A.I. for plotting, outlining or writing, and the majority said they did not disclose their A.I. use to readers, according to BookBub, a book discovery site that released the poll last May.) Even some authors who publicly oppose the technology are secretly signing up for Ms. Hart’s classes, she said.<p>The rapid incursion of A.I. generated stories is rattling some in the romance business. Publishers and authors worry that books by real writers are getting lost in the sea of digital slop, as A.I.-enabled novels flood the market.&quot;",HN_API

For a period of time it was popular for the industrial designers I knew to try to launch their own Kickstarters. Their belief was that engineering was a commodity that they could hire out to the lowest bidder after they got the money. The product design and marketing (their specialty) was the real value. All of their projects either failed or cost them more money than they brought in because engineering was harder than they thought. I think we’re in for another round of this now that LLMs give the impression that the software and firmware parts are basically free.

"Interesting project. Here's a thought which I've always had in the back of my mind, ever since I saw something similar in an episode of Buck Rogers (70s-80s)! Many people struggle with falling asleep due to persistent beta waves; natural theta predominance is needed but often delayed. Imagine an ""INEXPENSIVE"" smart sleep mask that facilitates sleep onset by inducing brain wave transitions from beta (wakeful, high-frequency) to alpha (8-13 Hz, relaxed) and then theta (4-8 Hz, stage 1 light sleep) via non-invasive stimulation. A solution could be a comfortable eye mask with integrated headphones (unintrusive) and EEG sensors. It could use binaural beats or similar audio stimulation to ""inject"" alpha/theta frequencies externally, guiding the brain to a tipping point for abrupt sleep onset. Sensors would detect current waves; app-controlled audio ramps from alpha-inducing beats to theta, ensuring natural predominance. If it could be designed, it could accelerate sleep transition, improve quality, non-pharmacological.",HN_HTML

All are defunct now, but DMOZ appears to live on as curlie. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_web_directories Technically, we could tag our RSS feeds with the taxonomy defined by ooh.dir, which would allow us to automatically sort blogs into topic groups, but I haven't found a single feed that uses the approach.

And last time the site got on HN the suggestions (not “submissions”) were swamped with mostly men with rarely-updated blogs about computers. I’m expecting more now :) I also enjoy searching for blogs that I find interesting and adding those, rather than relying solely on the suggestions. Honestly, I’ve been thinking of removing the suggestions form entirely, because it results in exactly this level of expectation and uncertainty about what gets “approved”.

In this case, another approach would simply be randomization, which doesn't favor any name (Aaaaaron Aaaaanderson's blog :P ), this randomization can be consistent (such that you can find something you wish in linear time). I think equally important is algorithmic transparency, that is, that the algorithm be publicly disclosed (although I think simplicity is a component of transparency: if you just dump a huge incomprehensible algorithmic mess somewhere that's not very helpful), so that you at least know what you are getting into, and better yet have some ability to choose and make educated critique of the current state of things (i.e. does the algorithm just maximize engagement like a slot machine? or does it optimize for some kind of helpfulness?).",HN_HTML

With mailbox you just need offset tables and a sentinel check for board edges. Curious what your evaluation function looks like though. At 2KB you can't fit piece-square tables (that's 384 values minimum for both colors), so are you doing material-only eval or did you squeeze in some positional heuristics? The gap between your 1200 Elo in 2KB and the TCEC 4K engines at ~3000 Elo is interesting. That extra 2KB buys a lot when it goes to better evaluation and move ordering. Even a simple captures-first sort in alpha-beta pruning costs only a few bytes of code but can roughly double your effective search depth.",HN_HTML
